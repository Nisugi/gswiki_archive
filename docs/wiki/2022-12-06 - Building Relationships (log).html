</p><p><br/>
You settle yourself on the suede couch for a moment's rest.
</p><p>You ask, speaking quietly to Falvicar, "How was your day darlin?"
</p><p>You quietly say, "I'll be working here an hour every day till the end of the week."
</p><p>You reach toward your ear, and the quill releases its hold on your ear.  Twining several tentacles about your fingers it shifts itself into your hand.
</p><p>Gazing into the flames, your mind wanders.  You relive old adventures and battles and plan greater triumphs yet to be.  It is pleasant to sit here and dream by the fire.  Perhaps you will conquer the world tomorrow, or another day.  There is always a tomorrow.  But for now, the fire lulls you warmly.
</p><p>Lady Elliathe just came through a chiseled marble arch leading to the hallway.
</p><p>Lady Elliathe just went through a riveted hoarbeam door.
</p><p>A halfling page hurries into the reception area and hands a document to the secretary with a trembling hand before scooting off.  The secretary scrutinizes the document and signs it before placing it on a stack for processing.
</p><p>You gaze in wonder at your surroundings.
</p><p>[Mayor's Office, Reception - 29543] (u4043049)
</p><p>Brightly lit by crystal-globed candles atop a caribou antler chandelier, the room is enclosed in walls of lacquered pine.  Facing a blackened rock fireplace, a waiting couch of dark suede sits with its back to an imposing angular oak desk with neatly organized parchments atop it.  A prim sylvankind secretary is seated behind the desk, which is positioned so that she can watch the entrance, visitors, and a riveted hoarbeam door leading to the mayor's office.  You also see a chiseled marble arch leading to the hallway.
</p><p>Also here: Chronicler Falvicar
</p><p>Obvious exits: west
</p><p>You quietly say, "Well she came and went."
</p><p>Lady Elliathe just came through a riveted hoarbeam door.
</p><p>Elliathe gathers the wide skirts of her stygian velvet houppelande in her hands and drops into a low curtsy while maintaining impeccable posture and grace.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "Good eve."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Good evening."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "How are you?"
</p><p>Elliathe says, "I hope the day finds you well, Councilor."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Are you here to sign up as a Deligate for Icemule?"
</p><p>Elliathe smiles at you.
</p><p>Elliathe affirms, "Indeed, I am."
</p><p>The fire sings its ancient song of security from the dangers of the night as you gaze into the comfortable blaze.
</p><p>You decide to write your letter in Common.
</p><p>You set your quill to your parchment and write down your thoughts to the body of the parchment.
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Wonderful And your name please?"
</p><p>A halfling page hurries into the reception area and hands a document to the secretary with a trembling hand before scooting off.  The secretary scrutinizes the document and signs it before placing it on a stack for processing.
</p><p>Elliathe warmly says, "I am Lady Elliathe of Icemule, Councilor."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "It is wonderful to meet you Lady Elliathe, did you have a cover letter with qualifications?"
</p><p>A pained expression crosses Elliathe's face.
</p><p>You quietly say, "It's alright M'lady it's not required."
</p><p>Elliathe says, "I fear I do not, I must admit. I hadn't realized I needed a letter, forgive me for my enthusiasm."
</p><p>Elliathe blushes and babbles a few incoherent words, looking sincerely flustered.
</p><p>Elliathe ponders.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Well if you change your mind and wish to provide one your always welcome to.. but again, it's not a requirement.  Just might help others to get to know you."
</p><p>You smile at Elliathe.
</p><p>Elliathe nods to you.
</p><p>You set your quill to your parchment and write down your thoughts to the body of the parchment.
</p><p>You show your parchment to Elliathe.
</p><p>You see nothing unusual.
</p><p>In the Common language, it reads:
</p>
<pre>Icemule Deligates List
 The Lady Elliathe of Icemule.
</pre>
<p><br/>
Elliathe wonderingly says, ""I am truly unsure what I would write, beyond a love of the freedom of our town. With all the events happening in the South, I worry about encrouchment on our sovereignty."
</p><p>The secretary gives a momentary glance at the mayor's office door before returning to her task of stacking envelopes.
</p><p>A log crashes and falls over into the fire.  The flames grow upon it slowly, like roses awakening, until the whole log is aglow with a garden of embers.
</p><p>You quietly say, "That is a valid concern."
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement to you.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "And I worry that, while the... shall we say 'spice' of our residents, that fire that keeps us warm, I fear that we need cooler heads in order to deal with the Vaalorians."
</p><p>Elliathe nods once.
</p><p>The fire dies down a bit until it finds some fresh wood to burn.  The flames dance higher as they feast.
</p><p>Elliathe admits, "I realize I am of a quieter bent than some, but I prefer to listen. To observe first."
</p><p>Elliathe smiles warm
</p><p>A low rumbling sound comes from your pearl white lizard that seems to come all the way from its stomach.
</p><p>Elliathe coughs.
</p><p>Elliathe smiles warmly
</p><p>You quietly say, "I agree with you Elliathe."
</p><p>You quietly say, "I think having a clear understanding of the purpose of going to Ta'Vaalor along with proper understanding of how to deal with the Ta'Vaalor would be the only way to go."
</p><p>Elliathe says, "While I do love our folks here... I fear some might hurtle us straight into an armed conflict. Not.. out of malice, but simply too much passion and love for our home."
</p><p>Elliathe grins from ear to ear.
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement to you.
</p><p>The secretary gives a momentary glance at the mayor's office door before returning to her task of stacking envelopes.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "If it makes any difference."
</p><p>Elliathe ponders.
</p><p>You ponder.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "I grew up in Waterford, a half-blood under the thumb of the edict. One learns early manners and proper behavior if one wishes to live peacefully."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Would you be willing to meet with an Advisor prior to Meeting with the Ta'Vaalorian governement for tips on court  ettiquette?"
</p><p>Elliathe asserts, speaking to you, "Absolutely. One cannot easily come to the desired conclusion by starting out with unknowing affronts."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Im not doing an interview or anything honestly just taking names but Im curious if that is something you'd feel would help the deligates to avoid war?"
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement to you.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "It all goes hand in glove with sending those who are reasoned and calm."
</p><p>Elliathe grins from ear to ear.
</p><p>You quietly say, "In the past we've had deligations go to Ta'Vaalor and they ended poorly or in the state we are in now."
</p><p>A grizzled member of the town guard marches in and inquires about the mayor's whereabouts.  After a brief conversation, the secretary shoos him off with a gentle scolding about Mayor Dabbings's busy schedule.
</p><p>A pained expression crosses Elliathe's face.
</p><p>You beam happily at Elliathe!
</p><p>Elliathe nods to you.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Thank you M'lady that is very reassuring to hear."
</p><p>The fire dies down a bit until it finds some fresh wood to burn.  The flames dance higher as they feast.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "So I have gleaned over time listening to our current conundrums."
</p><p>You quietly say, "I am sad to hear you had to put up with that kind of oppression in Waterform."
</p><p>Your cheeks flush with a soft pale rose shade, darkening your freckles even more.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "I may be a newer resident, but I have been trying my best to learn our history."
</p><p>Elliathe shrugs at you.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Waterford, I hope you never have to experiance that again."
</p><p>Elliathe sadly says, "The Empire what the Empire is."
</p><p>Elliathe says, "Which is why I worry so much for our Southern friends at the moment."
</p><p>You see Lady Elliathe the Voln Master.
</p><p>She appears to be a Half-Elf from Hendor.
She is short.  She appears to be youthful.  She has thick-lashed violet eyes and alabaster skin.  She has waist length, ringleted blue-black hair wrapped in an intricately looping pattern around a pair of crossed rib bones tied with sinew.  She has a delicate face, a small nose and slightly pointed ears.
</p><p>She has a scar across her neck, old battle scars on her right arm, old battle scars on her left arm, old battle scars on her left leg, old battle scars on her right hand, old battle scars on her left hand, an old battle scar across her chest, an old battle scar across her abdominal area, an old battle scar across her back, a black-and-blue right eye, and a scar across her face.
</p><p>She is holding a carved faewood runestaff in her right hand.
</p><p>She is wearing an elagant ruby flyrsilk pouch adorned in sovyn clove trinkets, a ruby-strung chain sporting a Liabo white moon pendant, a jute-strung pallid avian skull with a wire-bound beak, a shadowy black wraithaline medallion carved with runes, a flowing stygian robe trimmed with various bones, a mithril Twilight Hall pin, a sable-framed stygian velvet houppelande spilling into a train of weblike onyx satin over a ruby flyrsilk petticoat hemmed with embroidered acantha leaves with a soft white lawn chemise underneath, a bloom-laden faenor vine wristlet set with crimson-swept orange crystal thorns, a sun-etched gold ring, a thin black leather wand belt with a trio of scrimshaw buckles, an avian skull-clasped bag draped in layers of raw black silk, some pale silk stockings wrapped in black velvet vines under some deep black narrow-toed boots, and a smooth supple leather bodysuit with two silver eight-pointed stars on the collar.
</p><p>Elliathe exclaims, "This entire notion of the 'Barony of Darkstone' sends up all manner of red flags in my mind!"
</p><p>The secretary puts on a pleasant smile and pointedly asks, "Might I help you with something?"
</p><p>Elliathe smiles secre
</p><p>A pained expression crosses Elliathe's face.
</p><p>The fire sings its ancient song of security from the dangers of the night as you gaze into the comfortable blaze.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Sadly I've only heard bits of pieces of what is happening down south."
</p><p>Elliathe slowly empties her lungs.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Falvicar and I were in Ta'vaalor ourselves for parts of it and then I've been bogged down with council stuff."
</p><p>Elliathe says, speaking to you, "It is.. .very convoluted indeed. I have tried to keep myself abreast of all of it, to better serve our own town."
</p><p>A low rumbling sound comes from your pearl white lizard that seems to come all the way from its stomach.
</p><p>The zoetic quill folds its vane and, in a flurry of grasping tentacles, quickly pulls itself up your arm and across your shoulder.  From there it drags itself up behind your ear and settles in.
</p><p>You grab an iridescent quartz cricket box from inside your elesine sack.
</p><p>You reach into your quartz cricket box and pull out a small cricket.
</p><p>Falvicar nods slowly.
</p><p>Your pearl white lizard sees the cricket and freezes, its eyes locked on the cricket.  The very tip of the lizard's tail twitches, and it emits a soft huff of excitement.  Suddenly, the lizard darts forward, grasps the cricket in its jaws and gulps it down!
</p><p>Elliathe says, "And admittedly my House is in the Landing, so I do have some small stake in their health."
</p><p>You reach into your quartz cricket box and pull out a small cricket.
</p><p>You absent-mindedly drop an iridescent quartz cricket box into your elesine sack.
Your pearl white lizard sees the cricket and freezes, its eyes locked on the cricket.  The very tip of the lizard's tail twitches, and it emits a soft huff of excitement.  Suddenly, the lizard darts forward, grasps the cricket in its jaws and gulps it down!
</p><p>You remove a frost blue parchment from in your eahnor-plated pack.
</p><p>In the Common language, it reads:
</p>
<pre>Icemule Deligates List
 The Lady Elliathe of Icemule.
</pre>
<p>You quietly say, "Ohh that is understandable then."
</p><p>You nod.
</p><p>The secretary casually notes, "If you wish to see the mayor, you may want to make an appointment.  He's a busy halfling."  She does not avert her eyes from her paperwork.
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement to you.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "Also being a healer... well I am always willing to pitch in with the wounded."
</p><p>Elliathe grins from ear to ear.
</p><p>You quietly say, "I have friends in landing as well as Ta'Vaalor. I would not want anything bad to happen to either town."
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement to you.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "The Landing, near as I can tell is caught between several sides at this point."
</p><p>The fire dies down a bit until it finds some fresh wood to burn.  The flames dance higher as they feast.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "There is the Empire pushing ever closer with their settlement and new Barony. Then the Rooks who are opposed. Gnul and the trolls and Illoke are against the new Barony, the reivers too. And there is some sort of Naval ship also causing problems."
</p><p>Elliathe gazes heavenward.
</p><p>The secretary selects a series of parchments and heats some pale blue wax before carefully pouring a blob onto each.  She stamps each with a heavy mule-marked stamp before filing each document away in a drawer.
</p><p>A log crashes and falls over into the fire.  The flames grow upon it slowly, like roses awakening, until the whole log is aglow with a garden of embers.
</p><p>The fire brings a welcome warmth that seems to soak into your very bones and makes you feel relaxed.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Sounds so scary."
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement to you.
</p><p>The secretary converses politely with a tall, well-dressed citizen, directing him toward the town censor's office.
</p><p>You quietly say, "And I thought the Krolvin were bad."
</p><p>Elliathe admits, speaking to you, "There was quite the incursion two nights ago."
</p><p>Elliathe shudders.
</p><p>You quietly exclaim, "Your kidding!"
</p><p>Your pearl white lizard nips at the air.  Whether it has glimpsed a gnat or has succumbed to a case of wishful thinking is uncertain.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "Triage had to fall back through multiple locations. There were all manner of wild creatures in Gnuls forces as another Imperial caravan arrived."
</p><p>You feel the blood drain from your face.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "Griffons, stone creatures, trolls."
</p><p>You quietly exclaim, "That is so hard to do!"
</p><p>You quietly say, "Fall back with wonded."
</p><p>Elliathe says, "At one point, someone accidently grabbed my hand and fogged from Voln back into the middle of town... I had always wondered what a Sentinal looked like. Of course I didn't have eyes a moment after that."
</p><p>Elliathe laughs!
</p><p>Elliathe shakes her head.
</p><p>You shudder.
</p><p>Falvicar gazes in amusement at you.
</p><p>The fire brings a welcome warmth that seems to soak into your very bones and makes you feel relaxed.
</p><p>You glance at Falvicar, an eyebrow quirking slightly in his direction.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "And yes, very logistically difficult. But first we had creatures in the square, then they attacked in the inn as well."
</p><p>You reach toward your ear, and the quill releases its hold on your ear.  Twining several tentacles about your fingers it shifts itself into your hand.
</p><p>Elliathe gazes in wonder at her surroundings.
</p><p>Elliathe exclaims, "It was madness!"
</p><p>Elliathe says, "In any event I am grateful to have my name added, and for the consideration, Councilor."
</p><p>Elliathe smiles at you.
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Elliathe, "Thank you for volunteering M'lady."
</p><p>Elliathe asserts, speaking to you, "'Of course, I would do whatever I could for the betterment and safety of our town. Tis a special place owing to its freedom."
