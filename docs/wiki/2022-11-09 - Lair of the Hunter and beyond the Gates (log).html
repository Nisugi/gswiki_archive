<hr/>
<p>[Moonsedge, Briar Gate]
</p><p><br/>
Walls twice the height of a giantman loom over the cobblestone road as it winds toward the city.  Ornamental etchings of thorny briars adorn the stone faces, which are hewn from vast cubes of dark basalt.  The wall is unbroken save for a black gate of wrought iron that is adorned with countless wild roses fashioned of dark metal.  From within come none of the sounds of a thriving city, not wagons squeaking, nor the din of a throng.  You also see the Yardie disk, an inlaid leather grimoire soaring around with its gilt-swept ethereal violet pinions, a yellow-eyed silvery lor mandrake, a stocky snow white puppy with oversized black-tipped paws, the repousse copper Perigourd disk raised in leafy designs, the web-draped Missoni disk, the skull-shaped Zeminar disk, the Lilanna disk, the smooth invar Radoria disk, the driftwood Nalver disk, a red-eyed fanged black bat that is flying around, a lazy wild silver-grey dog, a resplendent obsidian black raven that is flying around and a massive snowy white tiger.
</p><p><br/>
Also here: Blade Yardie, Lilanna, Hadya, Merrymaker Gespry, Small Game Hunter Dendum, Trouthe, Lord Sorlu, Lady Aliashyrah, Lord Randsford, Perigourd, Missoni, Grutak, Queatus, Mayor Talliver, Magister Raelee, Bakarus, Jiarine, Nalver, Commodore Nodyre, Zeminar, Aenternoll, Radoria, Small Game Hunter Roelon
Obvious paths: north
</p><p><br/>
Nodyre says, "Oh my."
</p><p>Roelon tilts his head up.
</p><p>Radoria glances around the area.
</p><p>Missoni glances up.
</p><p>Hadya glances up.
</p><p>You gaze up into the heavens.
</p><p>Raelee tilts her head up.
</p><p>As a maniacal expression washes over Nalver's features, he erratically titters to himself.
</p><p>Bakarus gazes up into the heavens.
</p><p><br/>
<b>Roses, wild and domesticated, are painstakingly replicated in dark metal as adornments twining over the forbidding gate.</b>
</p><p>Perigourd glances at a wrought black iron gate.
</p><p>Trouthe gazes up into the sky.
</p><p>Perigourd tilts his head up.
</p><p><br/>
There is nothing on the gate.
</p><p>Gespry narrows his eyes.
</p><p>Nodyre places his hand against his white ora katana.  A collection of argent and ultramarine flames spiral down the length of Nodyre's white ora katana, setting it ablaze.
</p><p>Missoni slowly empties her lungs.
</p><p>Randsford clutches his eonake knight's aegis defensively.
</p><p>Zeminar tightens his grip on his grey-scaled staff.
</p><p>Queatus frowns.
</p><p>Trouthe squints.
</p><p>Jiarine asks, "Can I come inside?"
</p><p>You belt out, "Hello up there!"
</p><p>Dendum yells, ""Greetings!"
</p>
<pre>The voice of Barlan says, "So, our friends from Icemule Trace have returned."
</pre>
<p>Jaysehn says, "That palce is thoroughly overrun."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Greetings there Barlan."
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "You wished us here, no?"
</p><p>A blinding flurry of snowflakes drifts down from the grey skies.
</p><p>Randsford says, "Good evening Barlan, an audience with you if you could open your gates."
</p><p>Perigourd leans on his sword.
</p><p>Gespry steeples his fingers together, quietly observing his surroundings.
</p><p>Roelon deeply asks, "We did say we would speak again aye?"
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Dendum, "Guess he's not berry picking."
</p><p>Jiarine says, "I have not been here before so this would be our first meeting."
</p><p>Nalver searches around for a moment.
</p><p>Roelon grins at you.
</p><p>Dendum says, speaking to you, ""Good rose carving on gate though."
</p><p>Sorlu nods.
</p><p>You agree with Dendum.
</p><p>Nalver searches around for a moment.
</p><p>Grutak glances at a wrought black iron gate.
</p>
<pre>The voice of Barlan says, "We did indeed.  I had hoped my child would last longer before succumbing, but not all are meant to live forever."
</pre>
<p>Roelon deeply says, "Hmm.."
</p><p>Randsford sighs.
</p><p>Perigourd grunts.
</p><p>Missoni slowly says, "Your...child."
</p><p>Trouthe asks, "Your child?"
</p><p>Nodyre says, "This is fine."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "So ...ye knew all along."
</p><p>Sorlu raises an eyebrow.
</p><p>Roelon abruptly kicks at a wrought black iron gate!
</p><p>Dendum runs a hand over his buckskin jacket, cleaning off anything the surroundings might have left.
</p><p>Missoni shakes her head, totally at a loss.
</p><p>Grutak yells, "Open up!"
</p><p>Randsford whispers something to Grutak.
</p>
<pre>Talliver glares.
</pre>
<p><b>The severe snowstorm blankets the entire area into white drifts.</b>
</p>
<pre>Talliver's entire body tenses as he tightens his grip on his rolaren sword.
</pre>
<p>Gespry waves his hands in arcane gesticulations.  Ethereal motes of blue light begin to dance wildly at his fingertips as he quietly incants the words to a spell.
</p><p>Jaysehn grips his eahnor cresset sword with both hands.
</p><p>Gespry gestures at a wrought black iron gate.
</p><p>A wrought black iron gate vibrates slightly.
</p><p>Nalver whispers to the group, "If you got feared by the earlier stuff...probably don't want to be here."
</p><p>Grutak looks over at Randsford and shakes his head.
</p><p>Trouthe gestures at a wrought black iron gate.
</p><p>Nothing happens.
</p><p>Nalver chuckles.
</p><p>Rosemunde nods in greeting.
</p><p>Randsford grumbles.
</p><p>Rosemunde waves to Lilanna.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "The only sickness here is yirself it seems...."
</p><p>Randsford traces a simple symbol as he reverently calls upon the power of his patron...
</p>
<pre>The voice of Barlan says, "I granted him the gift of life everlasting, and he managed less than a week."
</pre>
<p>Grutak yells, "Come out and submit to the authorites Barlan."
</p><p>Jiarine asks, "Can you explain how this gift works?"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "What you gifted him was an abhorrence the Lady."
</p><p>Lilanna grins at Rosemunde.
</p><p>Lilanna clasps Rosemunde's hand tenderly.
</p><p>Lilanna's group just went north.
</p><p>Randsford says, "This is your one chance to come peacefully."
</p><p>Randsford taps his foot impatiently.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "The life of the un-living.."
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Sad."
</p><p>Hadya quietly says, "Perhaps you need to build them better...."
</p><p>Trouthe traces a sign while petitioning the spirits for cognition...
</p><p>Randsford nods at Grutak.
</p><p>Missoni wrinkles her nose.
</p><p>Dendum reminds, speaking to Randsford, ""Err...probably not best way to get gate open."
</p><p>Jaysehn smirks at Hadya.
</p><p>Grutak whispers to the group, "The gate is unbashable and climbable."
</p><p>Roelon grins at Dendum.
</p>
<pre>The voice of Barlan says, "I was skeptical when my men brought one of those brutes from the Crawling Shore, but my finest court conjurers studied the gifts that had been given to the half-krolvin."
</pre>
<p>Gespry melodically says, "Gate is open.."
</p><p>Hadya shrugs nonchalantly.
</p><p><b>Heavy gusts of wind cause the area to be blinded in white snow.</b>
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Just.."
</p><p>Missoni murmurs, "So this did begin there."
</p>
<pre>The voice of Barlan says, "Within their veins flowed the promise of death undone."
</pre>
<p>Dendum sighs.
</p><p>Jiarine says, "Tell us more."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Seemed pretty dead when they turned to ash."
</p><p>Roelon snorts!
</p><p>Sorlu agrees with Jiarine.
</p><p>Dendum inquires, speaking to Perigourd, ""So burn entire place down?"
</p><p>Perigourd nods in agreement at Dendum.
</p><p>Dendum nods at Perigourd.
</p><p>Perigourd says, speaking to Dendum, "As I advised Jaysehn already."
</p><p>Jaysehn nods.
</p>
<pre>The voice of Barlan says, "You could not hope to understand what I have lost."
</pre>
<p>Missoni quickly ducks behind Perigourd.
</p><p>Perigourd says, "We're listening."
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Besides reason."
</p><p>Randsford exclaims, "Then enlighten us!"
</p><p>Nodyre says, "Try us."
</p><p>Randsford stares upward.
</p><p>Aliashyrah ponders.
</p><p><i>open gate</i>
<b>That is already open.</b>
</p><p>Roelon rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p><i>go gate</i>
<b>Some unseen force is preventing you from doing that.</b>
</p>
<pre>The voice of Barlan sharply says, "But the gift that I have given my people... Moonsedge will never fall, now."
</pre>
<p>Nalver says, "Submit to Roan and pray for weakness."
</p><p>Hadya quietly asks, "What have you lost?"
</p><p>Grutak says, "Someone put fire on the walls and see if this place burns."
</p><p>Hadya cocks her head.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "The will to live, apparently."
</p><p>Nodyre gazes up into the heavens.
</p><p>Grutak asks, "Wanna bet?"
</p><p>Raelee cocks her head.
</p><p>Missoni says, "Perhaps you could be honest with us now, as you were not at the feast."
</p><p>Hadya asks, "What gift have you given them?"
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Grutak, "Stone is not known for burning easily."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "With magic it can."
</p><p>As a maniacal expression washes over Nalver's features, he erratically titters to himself.
</p><p>A slight shiver courses through your body as you shake off the cold.
</p><p>Sorlu frowns.
</p><p>Raelee surreptitiously glances at Hadya.
</p><p>Aliashyrah mentions, speaking mildly to Hadya, "It would appear he has granted, "eternal life" of a certain form at least."
</p><p>Nalver taps the tip of his ko'nag staff on the ground.
</p><p>Nalver taps his foot impatiently.
</p><p>Hadya says, "I am curious, of course... there are many ways to acheive that."
</p><p>Raelee nods slowly at Hadya.
</p><p>Perigourd says, speaking to Hadya, "Too true."
</p><p>Grutak asks, speaking to Sorlu, "Are those sappers still at the Inn?"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "And too many."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Eternity lasts until it reaches the edge of a liberating sword."
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Grutak, "The last I heard."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Might call them up here to tunnel under the walls."
</p><p><br/>
<i>go wall</i>
<b>You take a few steps toward some black basalt walls.</b>
<b></b>
Grutak says, "We can stage a group to rush in."
</p><p><i>go gate</i>
<b>Some unseen force is preventing you from doing that.</b>
</p>
<pre>The voice of Barlan asks, "Do you think I have not noticed the comings and goings of your man, 'Mayor' Dabbings?"
</pre>
<p><b>Heavy gusts of wind cause the area to be blinded in white snow.</b>
</p><p>Dendum remarks, speaking to a wrought black iron gate, ""Wonder if they need to eat?"
</p><p>Roelon squints.
</p><p>Randsford raises an eyebrow.
</p><p>Missoni narrows her eyes.
</p><p>Sorlu peers quizzically at Talliver.
</p><p>Bakarus glances at Talliver.
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "Why did Moonsedge not seek help prior if it was in distress, before turning to these deteestable methods?"
</p><p>Nalver says, "Barlan."
</p><p>Queatus frowns.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Dendum, "The dead don't usually eat."
</p>
<pre>The voice of Barlan says, "He has been spying upon us for months, sneaking back to that droll little tavern."
</pre>
<p>Nalver asks, "Barlan. Do you know the name Prangar?"
</p><p>You ponder.
</p><p>Dendum remarks, speaking to Grutak, ""Hrmm well they do not normally hold meetings in tent either yes?"
</p><p>Talliver surprisedly asks, "Tavern?"
</p>
<pre>Talliver says, "I don't know what you're talking about."
</pre>
<p>Perigourd says, speaking to Talliver, "The killer."
</p><p>Roelon shifts his weight.
</p><p>Perigourd furrows his brow.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Talliver, "I have never seen you at the tavern."
</p><p>Sorlu asks, "The inn?"
</p><p>Missoni curiously asks, "Did he have golden eyes?"
</p><p><b>A sudden gust makes the snow dance and swirl around you.</b>
</p>
<pre>Talliver says, "We scarcely knew that this place existed."
</pre>
<p>Roelon deeply asks, "Oh?"
</p><p>Gespry says, speaking melodically to Talliver, "I think he musta be confused as to who this mystery person is and who they work for."
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Roelon, "Wait what.."
</p>
<pre>The voice of Barlan says, "He wears your colors and your mule.  Do not pretend that we are not both liars down to the core."
</pre>
<p>Nodyre glances at Talliver.
</p>
<pre>Talliver asks, speaking quietly to Gespry, "What is he talking about?"
</pre>
<p>Jiarine raises her hand.
</p><p>Jiarine says, "I never pretended."
</p><p>Missoni shakes her head.
</p><p>Nalver chuckles.
</p><p>Perigourd says, speaking to Talliver, "I believe he thinks that the fellow who captured Reiphe was a spy of yours."
</p><p>Roelon whispers, "Aye... interesting...unless ....the golden eyed one is workin' fir the hall."
</p><p>Talliver asks, "Have any of you come out this way?"
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Hmm..."
</p><p>Aliashyrah calmly asks, "How close of a look did you get of him?"
</p><p>Roelon nods at Talliver.
</p><p>Nalver nods at Talliver.
</p><p>Sorlu nods slowly.
</p><p>Hadya says, in Tehir, something you don't understand.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Yes."
</p><p>Gespry says, speaking melodically to Talliver, "I think there is a third party involved, and they hiding out in our colors to confuse people."
</p><p>Gespry glances up.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "That Inn is ah rather interestin' place."
</p><p>Missoni says, "Not wearing a mule."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Talliver, "Only in the past few days."
</p><p>Nalver says, speaking to Talliver, "I was casting spells at the gate last night. Or the night before. I forget."
</p><p>Missoni looks thoughtful for a moment, then shrugs.
</p><p>Talliver asks, speaking to Roelon, "What inn?"
</p><p>You quietly say, "The Inn in the Glade."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Explorin' here after we found the way."
</p><p>Missoni agrees with you.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "There is an Inn."
</p><p>Talliver tersely says, "Take us."
</p><p>Roelon nods slowly at Talliver.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Months.."
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Small Game Hunter Roelon just moved quietly north, with his group following closely.
</p><p>[Moonsedge, Old Road]
</p><p>Through a break in the snow-dusted boughs of a great spruce, the silhouette of a castle at the top of the hills is black against a halo of moonlight.  Old and grim, the fortress looks down on a small city from its lofty perch.  Atop the walls of the city, faded crimson pennants fly, bearing the sigil of a briar sprig against a rising charcoal moon.  You also see a massive snowy white tiger and the Lilanna disk.
</p><p>Also here: Hadya, Merrymaker Gespry, Small Game Hunter Dendum, Trouthe, Lord Sorlu, Lady Aliashyrah, Lord Randsford, Perigourd, Missoni, Grutak, Queatus, Mayor Talliver, Magister Raelee, Bakarus, Jiarine, Nalver, Commodore Nodyre, Zeminar, Aenternoll, Radoria, Blade Yardie, Commodore Jaysehn, Small Game Hunter Roelon, GameHost Rosemunde, Lilanna
</p><p>Obvious paths: northeast, south
</p><p>Grutak asks, speaking to Talliver, "You've not been to the Inn?"
</p><p>Bakarus whistles tunelessly to himself.
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Small Game Hunter Roelon just moved quietly northeast, with his group following closely.
</p><p>[Moonsedge, Old Road]
</p><p>A forest of elm and birch and pine closes in upon the road as it climbs away from the strath below toward a walled city in the hills.  Carved wooden poles etched with fanciful briar motifs hoist lanterns aloft, but the lights are dark and cold despite the late hour.  Weeds and moss cling to the cobblestones of the roadway as if it has seen too few visitors to keep the encroaching vegetation at bay.  You also see a massive snowy white tiger.
</p><p>Also here: Hadya, Merrymaker Gespry, Small Game Hunter Dendum, Trouthe, Lord Sorlu, Lady Aliashyrah, Lord Randsford, Perigourd, Missoni, Grutak, Queatus, Mayor Talliver, Magister Raelee, Bakarus, Jiarine, Nalver, Commodore Nodyre, Zeminar, Aenternoll, Radoria, Blade Yardie, Commodore Jaysehn, Small Game Hunter Roelon
</p><p>Obvious paths: southwest
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Small Game Hunter Roelon just slipped quietly down a high woodland road, with his group following closely.
</p><p>[Olbin Delta, Old Road]
</p><p>Climbing into the hills that mark the southern end of the river valley, the pathway is a balding stretch of cobblestone being devoured by mosses and grass, but it widens into a full road as it climbs southward.  Through the elms crowding in from the northwest, the waters of the Frostmain are visible, choked heavily with silvery mist transformed into glowing clouds by the starlight.  You also see a massive snowy white tiger.

</p><p>Obvious paths: north
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Small Game Hunter Roelon just moved quietly north, with his group following closely.
</p><p>[Olbin Delta, Old Road]
</p><p>Woods crowd in on the highland ridge, but the old hoarbeams and Ossian pines do not grow thick enough to conceal an ancient roadway that glides southward toward the hills bordering the southernmost reaches of the delta.

</p><p>[Olbin Delta, Glade]
</p><p>Sunlight filters, cold and pale, through the colorful leaves of the surrounding trees, cold white rime tracing the jewel-toned foliage like diamond filigree.  The woods give wide berth to a respectably sized inn, its sturdy stone construction and freshly thatched roof both welcome glimpses of civilization in the untamed woodland.  Several carriages, too fine by half for the rustic setting, occupy the cobblestone yard.  You also see a massive snowy white tiger.

</p><p>Left open, the inn's stone-framed maple double doors allow in starlight and the susurrus of leaves from the glade outside.  The scents of birch and pine from without mingle pleasantly with the sharpness of woodsmoke and leather from within.

</p><p>Guarded by a long counter of dark-stained pine, the common room's bar boasts an impressive array of spirits in pristine bottles that come in all of the colors of the rainbow.  Several leather-upholstered stools sit along the counter's outer edge.  A half wall behind the bar provides a glimpse of the inn's kitchen and its hearths, above which game birds and other meats roast on wooden spits.

</p><p>A sprawling market forms a crescent around the vast black iron gate leading out of the city.  Stalls and wagons crowd the marketplace, huddling beneath maples that have been planted in earthen beds along its borders.  Discarded wares, from tattered remnants of silks to shattered potion bottles, are scattered in disarray across the pale white stones that form the crescent-shaped plaza and not a seller can be seen.  You also see a massive snowy white tiger, a stocky snow white puppy with oversized black-tipped paws, the driftwood Nalver disk, a horned basalt grotesque that is lying down and a red-eyed fanged black bat that is flying around.

[Moonsedge, Bramble Market]
A sprawling market forms a crescent around the vast black iron gate leading out of the city.  Stalls and wagons crowd the marketplace, huddling beneath maples that have been planted in earthen beds along its borders.  Discarded wares, from tattered remnants of silks to shattered potion bottles, are scattered in disarray across the pale white stones that form the crescent-shaped plaza and not a seller can be seen.  You also see an inlaid leather grimoire soaring around with its gilt-swept ethereal violet pinions, a silver lockpick, a shiny coin, a frost-covered yellow-eyed silvery lor mandrake, the web-draped Missoni disk, the smooth invar Radoria disk, the repousse copper Perigourd disk raised in leafy designs, the Lilanna disk, the skull-shaped Zeminar disk, the Yardie disk, a lazy wild silver-grey dog, a resplendent obsidian black raven that is flying around, a massive snowy white tiger and obvious signs of someone hiding.

Dendum asks, speaking to Perigourd, ""Creations?"
A cadaverous tatterdemalion ghast peeks up over the edge of a nearby rooftop and her clouded eyes narrow.  With a remarkable fluidity of motion given her ruined musculature and rotting flesh, she leaps from her perch and lands smoothly nearby, baring yellowed teeth in a rasping hiss!
Tenebrous shadows slip across Bakarus's pale skin as he demands divinity to heed his prayers.  As if in answer, his copper eyes briefly blacken as he releases his fury.
Bakarus gestures at a cadaverous tatterdemalion ghast.

<p>You hear a sound like a child weeping as a white glow separates itself from the tatterdemalion ghast's body and rises into the heavens.
A cadaverous tatterdemalion ghast lets out a hoarse cry that devolves into dry, rasping coughs. Spasms race through her form, dead muscles seizing and clenching before at last going still.
A cadaverous tatterdemalion ghast exhales the last of a virulent green mist.

[Moonsedge, Bramble Market]
A sprawling market forms a crescent around the vast black iron gate leading out of the city.  Stalls and wagons crowd the marketplace, huddling beneath maples that have been planted in earthen beds along its borders.  Discarded wares, from tattered remnants of silks to shattered potion bottles, are scattered in disarray across the pale white stones that form the crescent-shaped plaza and not a seller can be seen.  You also see a red-eyed fanged black bat that is flying around, a stocky snow white puppy with oversized black-tipped paws, a cadaverous tatterdemalion ghast that appears dead, an acid-pitted mithril chest, an inlaid leather grimoire soaring around with its gilt-swept ethereal violet pinions, a silver lockpick, a shiny coin, a frost-covered yellow-eyed silvery lor mandrake, the web-draped Missoni disk, the smooth invar Radoria disk, the repousse copper Perigourd disk raised in leafy designs, the Lilanna disk, the skull-shaped Zeminar disk, the Yardie disk, a lazy wild silver-grey dog, a resplendent obsidian black raven that is flying around, a massive snowy white tiger and obvious signs of someone hiding.

The shadows of the ash trees planted in loamy beds along the center of the row stretch long and strange in the moonlight.  Their leaves have almost filled the bed of a wagon that sits unattended in the middle of the roadway, forlornly dangling broken leather straps that ought to be attached to horses or mules.  You also see a massive snowy white tiger and obvious signs of someone hiding.

A retaining wall along the intersection holds back the earthen beds of several overgrown mountain ash trees that loom over the road.  The trees' branches are denuded of leaves but heavy with snow and clusters of berries, each as rich a red as a droplet of freshly spilled blood.  Graven into the retaining wall is a bas-relief of robed figures leading a procession.  The sign of a nearby inn creaks in the breeze.  You also see a massive snowy white tiger, a horned basalt grotesque and obvious signs of someone hiding.

You also see the smooth invar Radoria disk, a red-eyed fanged black bat that is flying around, an inlaid leather grimoire soaring around with its gilt-swept ethereal violet pinions, a massive snowy white tiger, a thrashing vathor club riddled with spiky clusters, the repousse copper Perigourd disk raised in leafy designs, the skull-shaped Zeminar disk, the web-draped Missoni disk, a yellow-eyed silvery lor mandrake and a lazy wild silver-grey dog.

[Moonsedge, Ash and Scarlet]
Mountain ash trees lean over the roadside, heavy with clusters of bright red berries.  They shadow the wreckage of a cleric's shop set back from the street, protected from prying eyes by high hedges.  Heavy doors of elm bear the scars of axe blows and the windows are shattered, but a barricade on the other side blocks entry.  You also see a red-eyed fanged black bat that is flying around, a massive snowy white tiger, the smooth invar Radoria disk, an inlaid leather grimoire soaring around with its gilt-swept ethereal violet pinions, the repousse copper Perigourd disk raised in leafy designs, the skull-shaped Zeminar disk, the web-draped Missoni disk, a yellow-eyed silvery lor mandrake and a lazy wild silver-grey dog.
