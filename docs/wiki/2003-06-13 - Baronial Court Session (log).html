On a low dais, spanning the southern end of the hall, three regal chairs of state rest before an embroidered tapestry of the Rising Swan of Vornavis that covers the wall behind them. Banners bearing the coats-of-arms of knights in service to the barony hang from the railing of the second floor gallery that lines the other three sides of the Great Hall. Opposite the dais a pair of large fel doors, inlaid with gold scrolling, are set in the north wall. You also see the icy blue Sluggy disk, the Seablade disk, the Karzak disk and an aged chamberlain.
Also here: Lord Gimmick, High Lord Atlanteax who is sitting, High Lord Grandevr who is sitting, Grolschin who is sitting, Mashiek who is sitting, Antinymous who is sitting, Skwirly, Tijay who is sitting, Itonje who is sitting, Songowl who is sitting, Tyrule who is sitting, Lord Sluggy, Kilthal, Kabo who is sitting, Apprentice Yukito who is sitting, Myrianna who is sitting, Settium, Eklinnaar, Aiwendil who is sitting, Seablade who is sitting, Benyark, Lady Seaaira who is sitting, Lithyia who is sitting, Lord Calean who is kneeling, Naem who is sitting, Rinika who is sitting, Vorpos, Karzak, Perigourd, Bersellius who is sitting, Charna, Daergard who is sitting, Malikary, Sylviana who is sitting, Valicar, Oogey who is sitting, Saberwolv who is sitting, Zero, Lord Shonison who is sitting, Shallimar who is kneeling, Lady Femereff, Lady Silverona, Shirkon, Errethe who is sitting, Shadowean, Adahain, Kriztian who is kneeling, Xanith, Yarx who is sitting, Geijon, Lady Aysia who is sitting, High Lord Cemb, Kinshack who is sitting, Yviara, Lord Sothog who is sitting, Earl Eddric, Baron Dunrith who is sitting
Obvious paths: none

Dunrith says, "Good evening, tonight I would like to begin with a few comments regarding recent events and to what degree they have impacted this barony, hopefully to answer some questions which may be on your minds."

Dunrith says, "First off, we are quite well aware of Jantalar's incursion towards Wehnimer's Landing and of the forces and crystals which are presently in that vicinity."

Dunrith says, "And while our hearts and interests are definitely on the side of those standing against Baron Hochstib, our present situation and that of the Landing makes aid from our hand rather a double-edged sword at present."

Dunrith says, "Hence, for reasons which Earl Jovery will explain shortly, we are not currently in a position to turn over those items and information regarding the Mestanir crystal which we would have expected to have provided by this time."

Dunrith asks, "Earl Jovery, perhaps now would be as good a time as any to provide that explanation...?"

Eddric nods.

Eddric says, "Rather simply, the Emperor has expressed an interest in determining more about the crystals and their origin, since prior to his assension he was ignorant of them to the degree that most of us were."

Eddric says, "Because of this, he will not sanction their destruction by agents of the empire, either directly or indirectly."

Eddric says, "This has the potential of playing into the Landing's interests, in that Baron Hochstib has received directions to move all such crystals to the capital as soon as is practical. Also, if a crystal is damaged while in his possession he will be held accountable for not supporting the Emperor's directive."

Eddric says, "He has of course sent apologies for his inability to immediately comply, but I am aware that pressure is being applied and he will soon need to do as directed or feel the growing displeasure of the throne."

Eddric says, "At present Baron Hochstib hasn't the means nor the political savvy to threaten the throne nor the Emperor so that is hardly a concern."

An aged chamberlain says, "Let us not speak out of turn. Your concerns will be addressed after the Lords conclude their statements."

Eddric says, "That will be dependent upon how quickly the Emperor pursues the matter. If Baron Hochstib were a vassal who entirely wished to please his lord he would already be moving his crystals towards Tamzyrr rather than the other direction."

Eddric says, "I believe Lord Malwind and myself have an additional item or two to address before we accept questions from those in attendance."

Eddric says, "On a totally different note, I would like to mention that although this audience seems to be markedly improved over the previous one which I attended, I find one or two details sadly lacking, and they are a cause of concern to me."

Dunrith raises an eyebrow in Eddric's direction.

Eddric says, "Not least of which is the lack of suitable attire by those in attendance...particularly notable in a few regards."

Eddric says, "I must say that within courts closer to the heart of the Empire no knight worth his salt would be caught at court without his spurs openly worn."

Eddric says, "Master Yarx Teelf, I see you are without spurs, will you come forward and kneel before me if you would accept the accolade of Knight of the Empire from my hand."

Yarx makes to stand in front of Eddic.

Yarx says, "Certainly, M'lord."

Eddric asks, "Do you swear to uphold the chivalric code, conducting yourself as a true knight, a living example of a warrior with honor, courage and generosity?"

Yarx says, "On my honor, M'lord."

Yarx nods to Eddric.

Eddric asks, "Do you promise to support the Empire and it's rightful ruler, never participating in nor supporting aggression against it nor its citizens?"

Yarx nods to Eddric.

Yarx says, "Yes, I do."

Eddric asks, "Finally, do you swear to continue to protect those whom seek the protection of your arm and the generosity of your heart, those too weak to protect themselves, and the virtue of every pure lady whom fate or fortune may cause to cross your path?"

Yarx says, "I do swear it, M'lord. Though many ladies may not approach me."

Yarx nods to Eddric.

Dunrith chuckles.

Dunrith removes a pair of golden spurs from in his black cloak.

Eddric gently taps Yarx on either shoulder with the backsword.

Eddric says, "I hearby dub you Sir Yarx Teelf, Knight Errant of the Empire."

Yarx says, "Thank you M'lord."

Yarx accepts Dunrith's golden spurs.

Eddric and Yarx shake hands.

Dunrith and Yarx shake hands.

An aged chamberlain clutches his staff between his elbows and manages a polite applause.

Yarx fiddles with the spurs for a moment.

Yarx puts on a pair of golden spurs.

Yarx bows to Dunrith.

Dunrith bows to Yarx.

Yarx bows to Eddric.

Eddric bows to Yarx.

Yarx bows to Edumond.

Eddric says, "Master Eahlstan Hjeldin, I see you are without spurs, will you come forward and kneel before me if you would accept the accolade of Knight of the Empire from my hand."

Yviara gasps.

Yviara clasps her hand over her mouth.

You say, "Such an honor is unexpected, but I will certainly do so."

You turn to face Eddric.

Eddric says, "Word comes from the field of battle of those who fight well and above them those who lead well. Your name is one such."

Yviara smiles at Eddric.

You say, "I only do what my duty requires, my Lord."

Eddric says, "If that were true I doubt you would be in this position."

Yviara smudges some tears as she tries to watch.

Eddric smiles.

Eddric asks, "Do you swear to uphold the chivalric code, conducting yourself as a true knight, a living example of a warrior with honor, courage and generosity?"

You say, "With all my honor, I do."

Eddric asks, "Do you promise to support the Empire and it's rightful ruler, never participating in nor supporting aggression against it nor its citizens?"

You say, "I do."

Eddric asks, "Finally, do you swear to continue to protect those whom seek the protection of your arm and the generosity of your heart, those too weak to protect themselves, and the virtue of every pure lady whom fate or fortune may cause to cross your path?"

You say, "I do swear."

Eddric nods.

Eddric gently taps Eahlstan on either shoulder with the backsword.

Eddric says, "I hearby dub you Sir Eahlstan Hjedlin, Knight Errant of the Empire."

Edumond says, "Sir Eahlstan."

Edumond bows to you.

Dunrith removes a pair of golden spurs from in his black cloak.

Dunrith smiles.

You accept Dunrith's offer and are now holding a pair of golden spurs.

You gaze in awe at the golden spurs in your hand.

You put on a pair of golden spurs.

You say, "I can think of no higher honor that you could bestow upon me. Surely, this has been one of the greatest evenings of my life."

You bow deeply at the waist, honoring Eddric.

You bow deeply at the waist, honoring Dunrith.

Dunrith bows to you.

Eddric bows to you.

You say, "and please, excuse this minor breech of protocol,"

You give Yviara a lingering kiss on the lips.

Eddric chuckles.

Yviara kisses you, her mouth lingering on yours.

You bow to Edumond.

Eddric says, "Master Kinshack Starblade, I see you are without spurs, will you come forward and kneel before me if you would accept the accolade of Knight of the Empire from my hand."

Kinshack averts his gaze and draws a slow breath.

Kinshack softly says, "I would be my honor, my Lord."

Kinshack kneels down.

Eddric says, "Although last of this this evening who are present to be honored, certainly not least, for as word of the battles travels across the countryside, always there is word of one or two exemplary warriors who outstrip the field and whose sword arm is unceasing. Before me kneels such a warrior."

Eddric asks, "Do you swear to uphold the chivalric code, conducting yourself as a true knight, a living example of a warrior with honor, courage and generosity?"

Kinshack says, "With the greatest honor, my Lord, I do."

Kinshack tilts his head down.

Eddric asks, "Do you promise to support the Empire and it's rightful ruler, never participating in nor supporting aggression against it nor its citizens?"

Kinshack says, "I do, proudly."

Eddric asks, "Finally, do you swear to continue to protect those whom seek the protection of your arm and the generosity of your heart, those too weak to protect themselves, and the virtue of every pure lady whom fate or fortune may cause to cross your path?"

Eddric says, "I hearby dub you Sir Kinshack Starblade, Knight Errant of the Empire."

Edumond says, "Sir Kinshack."

Edumond bows to Kinshack.

Eddric says, "Arise, Sir Kinshack."

Dunrith removes a pair of golden spurs from in his black cloak.

Dunrith offers Kinshack a pair of golden spurs.

Kinshack bows deeply.

Kinshack says, "I am humbled, my Lords."

Dunrith bows to Kinshack.

Eddric bows to Kinshack.

Kinshack accepts Dunrith's golden spurs.

Kinshack says, "Please, know that I will serve with the greatest pride."

Kinshack kneels down.

Kinshack puts on a pair of golden spurs.

Kinshack stands up.

Kinshack bows to Eddric.

Kinshack bows to Dunrith.

Eddric says, "So while we cannot at present provide more material aid to the cause or our neighbors to the north, yet we will highlight and endorse their right to rule themselves and establish their own identity within the sphere of the Empire."

Eddric smiles.
