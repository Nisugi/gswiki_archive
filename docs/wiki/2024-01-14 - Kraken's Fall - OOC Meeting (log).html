<ul><li>Erienne asks, "I was just wondering IF you were still planning to raffle the citizen bungalows, and if so, do you have an idea of when?"
<ul><li>Short answer, yes.</li>
<li>Long answer, waiting for a way to block people that aren't citizens over a certain time.</li></ul></li>
<li>Erienne asks, "Will there be more bungalows released?
<ul><li>In Krakens' Fall?  No</li>
<li>In the Wider World?  TBD</li></ul></li>
<li>Erek says, "This is not quite KF in topic but I'd love to hear about what plans ya'll might have for the Flotilla."
<ul><li>Confirmation that shop rotation is working through testing</li>
<li>Add more rotating shops</li>
<li>Do a little RP</li>
<li>Rumplesnoots to travel there</li>
<li>Have a gaming room and host DB or CW every now and again</li></ul></li>
<li>Leff asks, " I'm excited about the 2024 goals, can you talk about Atoll expansion, please? I wanted to possibly put on the radar a request for a second level to the Atoll, as an ascension area. Also, can you talk about plans for the KF festival. I feel like it might still be 5 years out?"
<ul><li>Added rooms to the Grotto for foraging tasks</li>
<li>KF festival is slated for 2028, no formal plans yet</li>
<li>Ascension is not yet slated for KF</li></ul></li>
<li>Leff asks, "The improvements have been massive, but any chance we could get a warrior guild place to buy service packs?"
<ul><li>Will be researched</li></ul></li>
<li>Yardie says, "Are there going to be those one a month RP stuff?  Like, I think you'll find KF being people itching to RP, and leaving the craziness out there.  We don't have requests for how the stories are told, just....stories being told and being a part."
<ul><li>We encourage everyone to do these, but it is our goal to do them more</li></ul></li>
<li>Yardie asks, "Second.  Justice.  Considering this is a...town that has law but not law, would you do something with justice not being around at night?"
<ul><li>This is not going to be allowed</li></ul></li>
<li>Yardie asks, "Food has been amazing here.  AMAZING.  When you guys have cooking meats and stuff like that, can you have some unique to KF?  Mussels?  Stone Crab?  Pheasant?  Some sort of meat?"
<ul><li>Yes, we can work on that.</li>
<li>Though, the game is large so they may not stay unique long.</li></ul></li>
<li>Holley says, "I was wondering if it would be possible to see whether Confluence portals can be added to spawn in the KF area?  As this was the last town created after the release of the Confluence, I believe it was overlooked especially with the change in Dev leadership around that time, since this is the only town that doesn't have access.  Thank you."
<ul><li>A request can be made</li>
<li>Its a process to get built</li></ul></li>
<li>Holley asks, "If there are butcher shops added to allow cooking meat, can we remember to include regular beef and bacon, please?"
<ul><li>We will look into it</li></ul></li>
<li>Holley says, "A milkable cow somewhere would be great."
<ul><li>We will look into it</li></ul></li>
<li>Trallihn asks, "So... on the topic of foraged items, did we ever get wiregrass here for ranger trinkets?"
<ul><li>Yes</li></ul></li>
<li>Trallihn says, "Secondly... can we get a keep Kraken Falls Clean sign in the market like we have in the neighborhood? Maybe that mentions the barrel is right there...."
<ul><li>We will look into it</li></ul></li>
<li>Trallihn says, "Donuts... we have wings, maybe donuts on a stand somewhere too."
<ul><li>We will look into it</li></ul></li>
<li>Yardie says, "Docks."
<ul><li>Thandiwe recently found a note in a script that might allow for beach fishing</li>
<li>It could either be really complex or quick</li>
<li>She's researching it</li></ul></li>
<li>Erienne says, "Is there any word about the Captain's Chest?  If someone already asked, you can just slap me silly and tell me to look back."
<ul><li>This is an OSA systems question and not something town Gurus have the answers to.</li></ul></li>
<li>Yardie says, "Arena in KF.  Pass it on."
<ul><li>It was pointed out that there was one on the Floatilla</li>
<li>But it will be looked into, no promises.</li></ul></li></ul>

</p><p>Elysani says, "Just not the other L name."

</p><p>Thandiwe says, "We did a lot more than I thought we had done."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "But 2023 was a long year."
</p><p>Erek says, "My elderflower liquor thanks you."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Imagine if we were vocal and needy..."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Desorceri, Tabubu says, "Soon."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "You are so needy Deso."

</p><p>Leff says, "Ooo."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Ooh."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "We have been fortunate that GM Elidi has agreed to help us with a bunch of behind the scene things."
</p><p>Yardie exclaims, "Yay Elidi!"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Many of us wear multiple hats, so we do try our best to get things done here when those other hats don't draw us."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "We have a lot of fun here."
</p><p>Erienne says, "It shows, this place is amazing."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Love it here."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "What isn't there to love about here."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "If you morph into a Hydra it would be a lot easier to wear multiple hats."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "Is my favorite vacay spot."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Move the invoker to MH whenever y'all do, and I'll never leave."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "Agreed. This town really is an amazing place thanks to every single person here (and a few missing folks too)."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Just gimme more green crystal bottles and the invoker can retire."
</p><p>Elysani says, "And that's always a challenge when your character is physically in a location away from the mainland game."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Yeah, Wyrmheart and Leff and Erienne, they've been killing it here."
</p><p>Erienne says, "As if you guys really need the invoker."
</p><p>Speaking to Desorceri, Agathilea says, "Hear hear."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "How that we've had our recap and goals list shared, let's go ahead and open the floor to player questions, comments, and what not."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Now, not how."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Like obedient school children."
</p><p>Speaking to Erienne, Leff says, "You first..."
</p><p>You ask, "Erienne?"
</p><p>Erienne asks, "I was just wondering IF you were still planning to raffle the citizen bungalows, and if so, do you have an idea of when?"
</p><p>You ask, "Oh, did I not do that yet?"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Short answer, yes, that is still planned -- because I thought I had done it."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Longer answer, I think I was looking for a portal that would block citizens that didn't meet a certain "TIME" requirement before setting up the raffle."
</p><p>Wyrmheart raspily says, "Jah bin eatin ta much pie. Makin da brain sof mon."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "So let me get that back on my agenda."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "That hat got stuck in another hat... happens."
</p><p>You ask, "Did you have anything else Erienne?"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I don't want to rush to the next person if you aren't finished."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Will there be more bungalows released?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "I've noticed more doors than owners."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "She forgot to mention donuts."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "In Kraken's Fall?  No.  What's here is here."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "In the wider world, TBD."
</p><p>Yardie says, "I hope so.  It's a beautiful idea."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Workshop is on the agenda already..."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I have no further questions."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "We need a neighborhood watch for peeping Thomasinas."
</p><p>You ask, "Close your door?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "There are a few random men wandering aroundn in and out of everywhere constantly."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "No just a joke about her counting doors vs owners."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Open door policy?"
</p><p>Trallihn asks, "If the doors are closed, where am I supposed to leave mice?"
</p><p>Yardie says, "And fieldmice."
</p><p>You ask, "Erek?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "Oh hey."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Lots of fieldmice."
</p><p>Erienne exclaims, "I never said I looked inside them!"
</p><p>Erek says, "This is not quite KF in topic but I'd love to hear about what plans ya'll might have for the Flotilla."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Hard not to notice when you are walking by."
</p><p>Desorceri exclaims, "Jussajokemkay!"
</p><p>Erienne says, "Ohh."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Is it still stuck in the far northeast corner?"
</p><p>Erek says, "It's a fantastic idea and I'd love to use it more."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "I need to get back with my coder-in-crime and make sure our rotating shop stuff is working."
</p><p>Agathilea mouths, "Trallihn's trusty fieldmouse supply."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Once we're sure, we need to make sure we have enough shops to rotate."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "But the plan.... add in rotating shops."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I have no idea where they came from."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Do some more RP there."
</p><p>Erek says, "One suggestion is maybe to force it to swing east to west or vice versa in case it "gets stuck".  Maybe no more than 2 or 3 months at a time on one side of the world."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "I've got plans for Rumplesnoots to travel out there when we're ready too, and we have an unpainted gaming area that when done, we can host DB on and CW from time to time."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "If it's stuck somewhere, I'll talk to Retser about that, because that's well beyond my knowledge."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Neat."
</p><p>Erek says, "Oh it's just that there's so much more ocean now than when it was released.  It's easy for it to turn around and go the other way."
</p><p>Elysani asks, "Is it still near Mistwatch?"
</p><p>Nadale says, "It was in the early part of December."
</p><p>Erek announces, "No futher questions, your honor."
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Is it supposed to stay near KF?"
</p><p>Xynwen says, "No, it's supposed to roam the seas."
</p><p>Elysani says, "It's supposed to be floating around... that."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "Erek also forgot to mention donuts."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I'm pretty sure it has been near Mistwatch for several months."
</p><p>Holley says, "I think it's always been near Mistwatch."
</p><p>You ask, "Leff?"
</p><p>Leff says, "Alright, earnest Leff blah coming..."
</p><p>Leff asks, "As a player, I want to look backward and forward at the same time. So, looking backward, I want to apologize in game directly, that the rollout of the bungalows was so controversial. I just want you to know, that you handled it with grace and dignity. And I appreciate it. Second, looking foward, I was concerned that maybe we had turned staff off from loving this place. And if I did, I am sorry. That being said, the amount of love you have shown this place over the last year, is awesome. I want to particularly say that the pirate invasion a few weeks ago was possibly, the most fun I have had in this game since the late 90s. Just because it felt like something was happening here at home. And I loved that. So much. I'm excited about the 2024 goals, can you talk about Atoll expansion, please? I wanted to possibly put on the radar a request for a second level to the Atoll, as an ascension area. Also, can you talk about plans for the KF festival. I feel like it might still be 5 years out?"
</p><p>Speaking to Leff, Yardie says, "Man you were fine."
</p><p>Speaking to Leff, Yardie says, "It was just a great idea that people got passionate about."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Oh, the Atoll expansion is just a few rooms because of some concerns raised in 2023 OOC Meeting."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Also, Leff, you didn't turn us off, its just that we -- all of us -- wear a lot of hats."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I'd love to find a dedicated Guru for you but it isn't in the cards yet."
</p><p>Elysani says, "So you get a hybrid multi-headed one."
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "For grotto foraging?"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "That being said, those of us that do stuff here truly love the town from top to bottom."
</p><p>Yardie says, "See?  There.  Guru."
</p><p>Erek says, "Guhydra."
</p><p>Speaking to Agathilea, Yardie mutters, "Worth a shot."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "We can tell, you don't try to burn it down like some other places."
</p><p>Agathilea announces, "GM Elysani belongs to me."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "Us."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "The elves."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Phooey."
</p><p>Leff says, "I wonder if you might consider bumping up the KF event? But I know you have a calendar and many roles to keep."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "One second, I'm conversing with someone to get you a better answer."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Sorry, I got sidetracked."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "The atoll expansion will add a few rooms for the grottos."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "That should help with the foraging issues brought up at the last meeting."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "Will one of them have a nice portal to my home, it's a long swim afyer all."
</p><p>Leff says, "Makes sense. Those areas do spawn, so that should help too."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Poor thing."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "It will, but it auto-drowns you."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "I can deal with that."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Washes you ashore for the coconut crabs."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Stock up on totem heads."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Ouch."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Coconut crabs are the devil."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Leff, you asked about the Atoll getting ascension hunting and the honest answer is that hunting grounds have a waiting list.  Until the current requests are dolled out, we can't really get on that waiting list and unfortunately, I'm not really able to answer on what is planned."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "As for the Kraken's Fall Festival, the way that we have things sourced right now is that every year we have 2 free festivals.  Kraken's Fall will be getting one, but I think its not until 2027-- don't quote me as I don't have that on hand."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "So far out."
</p><p>Leff says, "I couldn't recall from your Simucon speech. I tried to look it up, but couldn't recall specifically either."
</p><p>Speaking playfully to you, Yardie jokes, "Why you making me have to stay healthy to be alive for so long?!"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "We do not have a formal plan for it yet, as that's a lot of time and we have a bunch of pressing matters we have to handle first."
</p><p>Speaking amusedly to Yardie, Thandiwe says, "I'm going to tell your daughter you said that."
</p><p>Holley says, "The last posted schedule said it was for December 2028."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "2028."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Yardie says, "She already knows.  Made a promise to her.  That's why I am a gym rat."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "We do not have a formal plan for it yet, as that's a lot of time and we have a bunch of pressing matters we have to handle first."
</p><p>Speaking amusedly to Yardie, Thandiwe says, "I'm going to tell your daughter you said that."
</p><p>Holley says, "The last posted schedule said it was for December 2028."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "2028."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Yardie says, "She already knows.  Made a promise to her.  That's why I am a gym rat."
</p><p>Leff says, "I know we think of this game in decades. But 2028 is a long way away."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "A lot can happen in a day."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Yea, I know, you should see my to-do lists."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "No eye-bleeds for me, thanks."
</p><p>You ask, "Were there any other questions I could answer for you Leff?"
</p><p>Leff says, "Oh, I think I'm done except for one small request."
</p><p>Leff asks, "The improvements have been massive, but any chance we could get a warrior guild place to buy service packs?"
</p><p>Leff asks, "For gritting?"
</p><p>Erek says, "I like grits."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Better than eggs."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I can jot that down but I'm not sure what it is so it will require research."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Only if it's called The Nitty Gritty."
</p><p>Leff says, "Otherwise, I do want to just acknowledge how many massive QOL improvements we've gotten."
</p><p>Leff says, "In order to do warrior weapon/armor services you have to buy service packs from the warrior guild."
</p><p>Leff says, "25k per pack."
</p><p>Leff says, "So, in order to do them here, you have to go to FWI or back to a different city."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I've added it to our resarch list."
</p><p>Leff says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Er research."
</p><p>You ask, "Deso?"
</p><p>Leff says, "That's it for me. THank you."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "You also forgot the donuts."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Okay just want to add desire for the Kraken Lime Festival, and donuts.  I read the Legend of the Atoll today and got inspired for the cursed box game in the Communal.  I posted some ideas on Discord."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "And if we ever get an ascension hunting ground, can it include some underwater hunting? I think that would be very innovating and unique to KF."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "I like that idea, underwater fighting."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "That sounds like a trick to get me to bathe...."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Seamonster."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Trallihn, Tabubu says, "Whatever it takes."
</p><p>Speaking to Trallihn, Desorceri says, "You can re-muck yourself on shore."
</p><p>You ask, "So... is there a question there, Deso?"
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Can we and please?"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Nothing I need an immediate answer on no.  Just wish list items."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Well, I'm glad you are excited about the Kraken's Fall Festival (I've noted your vote for limes)."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Xynwen did an amazing job on the Legend of the Atoll."
</p><p>Erek asks, "Lime Donuts?"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Yes we need kraken limes, green budda's hand fruits."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Oh wait, there is a vote for what it can be?  them coconut crabs have my vote."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "We aren't getting hunting, but I did not you want underground on the off chance it happens somewhere down the line."
</p><p>Leff says, "We're kindof running in the gaps with the RP."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I've also noted your post on the Games Box from the Atoll."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "It would be interesting to see what happens there."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Pineapple."
</p><p>Speaking to Desorceri, Leff asks, "You saw the box in Outcast Hall?"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Thank you all for the KF love, support, and fun."
</p><p>Speaking to Leff, Desorceri says, "Gimme tour soon."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "We do have another round of foraged items coming up and I think pineapple is in that."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I think I need to pester someone about making hummingbird pie."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Pineapple coconut rum."
</p><p>Yardie says, "That's a staple."
</p><p>You ask, "Yardie?"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Pineapple coconut rum pies, cakes, and.. donuts."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Okay, got a few.  First off, love Kraken's Fall and love sharing the goodness here."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Are there going to be those one a month RP stuff?  Like, I think you'll find KF being people itching to RP, and leaving the craziness out there.  We don't have requests for how the stories are told, just....stories being told and being a part."
</p><p>Yardie says, "We are happy to share those little meet ups like Glyn and others, and they've been great and brought a lot of life."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "We hope to have RP moments, but we don't have a formal story to tell just yet.  We are working on a bigger, over arching one for 2025 but our ideas are kind of on the grandeous side so we wanted time to really build for it. I can say absolutely nothing else on that topic."
</p><p>Yardie says, "A formal story would be grand.  But I will say, the little things?  Just as delightful."
</p><p>Leff says, "100%."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Yea, I have to say I thoroughly enjoy the Pirates."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "For the one-off RP things, we do want to do more of those, and we encourage ALL of our GMs to think about KF when they want to do it."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Just remember again though, that the three of us sort of keepign KF on our special radar to make sure you don't get left out are also doing a bunch of other things, so we can't commit to a monthly deal."
</p><p>Leff says, "The great thing about one-offs is *anyone* around can be involved. And I love that."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "We can commit to trying to do more one-offs and to keep reminding everyone to do those."
</p><p>Yardie asks, "Second.  Justice.  Considering this is a...town that has law but not law, would you do something with justice not being around at night?"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Uh."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "No."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Awww."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Okay, last question."
</p><p>Leff says, "What about... no justice at night time."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "And the reason for that is this isn't a PvP game and while many of you may have fun --"
</p><p>Speaking to Leff, Agathilea says, "He keeps stealing my socks."
</p><p>Leff says, "Oh, to be clear, I don't want it for PvP."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "There are many more people that won't."
</p><p>Leff says, "I want it for RP."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Arena then.  Bring an arena.  And neither do I.  It's not for PvP."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "It's for stealing socks."
</p><p>Leff says, "To be very clear, I don't enjoy PvP really."
</p><p>You ask, "You do, but can you imagine how that thread asking for a PvP place will go if they find out that there isn't justice here?"
</p><p>Xynwen exclaims, "Go to the flotilla for the fighting bar!"
</p><p>Yardie exclaims, "Bring it here!"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "There is that, too."
</p><p>Leff happily says, "I mean, there's no justice on the flotilla, and no one is going there."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "We don't want to invite those savages."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Which is crazy."
</p><p>Leff says, "But, thank you for considering."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Park the floatilla outside."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Last question.  Food and grocer."
</p><p>Leff exclaims, "I have to go take my kids to swimming. Thank you again all!"
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Swimming? He must be in a warm place and now I am jealous."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "Or... those kids are building character."
</p><p>Yardie asks, "Food has been amazing here.  AMAZING.  When you guys have cooking meats and stuff like that, can you have some unique to KF?  Mussels?  Stone Crab?  Pheasant?  Some sort of meat?"
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "You can get shell fish if you have a rake."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "Most fun I have had in a while."
</p><p>Yardie says, "I'll do the rest in the pan."
</p><p>Speaking to Tabubu, Desorceri asks, "Find yours yet?"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Yea, I'm sure that we can look into making sure that there are unique offerings all over."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Desorceri, Tabubu says, "Bought a new one."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "There are no donuts how is that amazing."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Thank you...for everything."
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "What's the name of said donut shop?"
</p><p>Xynwen says, "It can be hard to keep unique things unique for long...it's a huge game, and the food system is ginormous, so remembering that "X meat is only to be used in Y place" can be a daunting exercise."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "It starts off easy....but over the years, it goes insane."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "Donut Palace."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Yes, I know, I am working my way throught the list and letting people have their time."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Donuts."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Did Nordred move here?"
</p><p>Ardwen says, "No but he has excellent taste in pastry."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Erienne says, "I've been...absentminded for...well, I was going to say the last 15 minutes or so but."
</p><p>Speaking to Yardie, you ask, "Before we move on, did you have anything else?"
</p><p>Speaking to Ardwen, Desorceri says, "Donut Tempt Me."
</p><p>Yardie says, "That's it.  I'll try to work on a player storyline for KF."
</p><p>Yardie says, "It'll suck."
</p><p>Yardie says, "But there's hope."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Ardwen, Tabubu says, "He is getting good at this."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "Add donuts it will be great."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Maybe with those wanted signs you got going."
</p><p>You ask, "Holley?"
</p><p>Speaking to Yardie, Desorceri exclaims, "You got this!"
</p><p>Holley says, "I was wondering if it would be possible to see whether Confluence portals can be added to spawn in the KF area?  As this was the last town created after the release of the Confluence, I believe it was overlooked especially with the change in Dev leadership around that time, since this is the only town that doesn't have access.  Thank you."
</p><p>Speaking to Yardie, Agathilea says, "Could make it a group effort."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Ooh, that is a good question too."
</p><p>Yardie exclaims, "That's a good idea!"
</p><p>Yardie says, "On both counts."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "So Confluence is definitely a Dev approval required process.  Each area that has the Confluence has its own realm and it has to be built."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I can put in a request but I can make zero promises for it."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "I've also got a question or two..."
</p><p>Holley says, "I believe it was just an oversight, but it seems like it might be an easier approval than creating a new hunting ground any time soon."
</p><p>Holley says, "Thank you for inquiring."
</p><p>Holley asks, "If there are butcher shops added to allow cooking meat, can we remember to include regular beef and bacon, please?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "Mmm."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I've noted your request."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Mmm bacon."
</p><p>Holley says, "And there don't seem to be cows to milk anywhere either."
</p><p>Erienne exclaims, "Second those requests!"
</p><p>Xynwen says, "I declare KF to be a moo-free zone."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Well, I don't think there are actually any cattle on this island."
</p><p>Holley says, "I mean in the whole game."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "It doesn't even have chickens."
</p><p>Holley says, "That was just more a general piggyback request."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "Goat milk might be a possibility."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Maybe goats."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "There is actually a herd of cows that crazes out on the river heading to/from the Atoll."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I feel like."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "Grazes."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Each bungalow should come with at least one chicken."
</p><p>Holley says, "There are references to cows and beef all over, unlike chickens, so."
</p><p>Holley says, "A milkable cow somewhere would be great."
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Oh?"
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "I was trying to remember where it was, I could of swore I saw one here too."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Guinea bird."
</p><p>Yardie says, "But pheasant instead."
</p><p>Yardie says, "But guinea bird is so delicious."
</p><p>Erienne says, "But guinea doesn't exist here."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Alas."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Hence no guinea pigs."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "Make them eat rock doves."
</p><p>Erienne says, "However."
</p><p>Speaking to Erienne, Trallihn says, "I had a brooch that smelled like hay that was a guinea pig..."
</p><p>Erienne says, "It's a guinea pig."
</p><p>Liras exclaims, "This is the third town meeting I've been to and they've all had questions about animals to milk!"
</p><p>Xynwen say, "Okay, Thandiwe is having connectivity concerns."
</p><p>Liras says, "Also hi I'm Liras, I don't live here but I'm learning to sail my sloop so I'm at the docks a lot."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Aww."
</p><p>Holley says, "Food is a popular subject."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "We hear and understand that some expansion to the farming-like stuff be added."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Much like River's Rest, the answer here remains the same -- we know people want it, and we're looking at it."
</p><p>Erienne says, "There were chickens actually."
</p><p>Erienne says, "At Feywrot."
</p><p>Holley says, "If cows are more appropriate elsewhere, then that's certainly fine with me, but I was just making an observation we don't have cows to hunt so we can't milk them at present."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Understood."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Weee."
</p><p>Xynwen asks, "I was mostly here for interjections and moral support, but after Holley, did anyone else have a hand up?"
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Oh good."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Trallihn has a question."
</p><p>Trallihn asks, "So... on the topic of foraged items, did we ever get wiregrass here for ranger trinkets?"
</p><p>Ardwen says, "This one better be about donuts."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Let me check on that for you, Trallihn, one second."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Something to make anklets and bracelets that are tropical would be amazing."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "Banana leaf."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Banana leafs."
</p><p>Ardwen says, "Or ti leaf."
</p><p>Speaking to Erienne, Trallihn says, "Be nice to see an upgrade to that side like the amulets for bark got... currently its still just the wiregrass last I checked."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Yes, wiregrass was added but dont' ask me where."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Yes."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "Secondly... can we get a keep Kraken Falls Clean sign in the market like we have in the neighborhood? Maybe that mentions the barrel is right there...."
</p><p>Yardie says, "I actually love that sign."
</p><p>Speaking to Erienne, Desorceri asks, "Can we use seagrass for weaving?"
</p><p>You ask, "Are people not keeping the Market clean?"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Trallihn says, "I am..."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Wait, you love a sign that says something about clean---"
</p><p>Yardie says, "That sign has a lot of identity."
</p><p>Speaking to Desorceri, Erienne exclaims, "I hope so, it only makes sense!"
</p><p>Yardie says, "It tells you a lot about the place without saying a word."
</p><p>You ask, "Are Thandiwe saysing you want a sign so you can ignore it?"
</p><p>Yardie says, "We look out for each other here."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "I refuse to throw my shells away, they are suppose to be everywhere."
</p><p>Yardie exclaims, "We don't ignore it!"
</p><p>Erienne exclaims, "Yes!"
</p><p>Speaking to Yardie, you exclaim, "You dont'!"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Trallihn says, "Yes... I know that's the weirdest thing me wanting a clean sign."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Seemed ironic to say the least."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "That's why we need justice accuse littering so we don't become Landfill Island."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Seriously.  It gives KF a lot of identity...how people look out for each other here."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Simple, but rich in identity."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "Third..."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "Donuts... we have wings, maybe donuts on a stand somewhere too."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I will look into it."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "And there's the thief head with it's perfect comedic timing."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Mmm donuts would definately have a spot in my basket doohickey."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly asks, "Is there a place to fish?"
</p><p>Trallihn says, "I'll keep looking for the wiregrass, got a few spots I haven't poked around in yet. Good to know it's here."
</p><p>Speaking to Tabubu, Trallihn says, "The docks."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Maybe Copper Potts could add some donuts to the menu."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Docks."
</p><p>Yardie asks, "But maybe someday in the Cradle?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "I believe there are also tart lovers among us."
</p><p>Yardie asks, "Maybe?"
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Ah good to know."
</p><p>Yardie asks, "Maaaaaybe?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "Maybe in Cliffwalk."
</p><p>The voice of Yardie whispers aloud, "Ocean fissssssssshing."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Oooh."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "What do you mean docks?  Like another fishing dock?  I recently found a note in a script that might allow you to sit and fish on the beach... I'm researching further."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "But."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "That'd be fun."
</p><p>Erienne exclaims, "Ocean fishing from the beach!"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "There are ocean fish."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "There is a whole pier."
</p><p>The voice of Yardie exclaims, "Oh wow!"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "It is on the southwestern side of the island."
</p><p>Yardie asks, "You found a note ina  script?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "Southeast."
</p><p>Yardie exclaims, "Fish on the beach!"
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Wonderful."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Yardie exclaims, "Yes!  Yes yes yes!"
</p><p>Erienne says, "I would love to be able to sit on the beach and fish."
</p><p>Yardie exclaims, "Pleaaaaaaaaaase!"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Trallihn exclaims, "Beach fishing does sound great!"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Charter fishing."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Then when I want a break from fishing, I could fly my kite on the beach."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I've got to finish the research but we will see what happens."
</p><p>Erienne says, "OH."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I have another question."
</p><p>Speaking to Erienne, Desorceri exclaims, "Then go kite surfing!"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "It could either be a quick thing or a huge process, I just don't know yet."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "I'm all done with my questions..."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Ooh."
</p><p>Ardwen asks, "Can we use rangers as bait for the fish?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "If they don't kill you first."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "Spikethorn fishing.... heh..."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "That about covers everything."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Is there any word about the Captain's Chest?  If someone already asked, you can just slap me silly and tell me to look back."
</p><p>Holley says, "I'm waiting on that before I decide whether to buy more ships."
</p><p>Speaking to Erienne, Desorceri asks, "Wassat?"
</p><p>You ask, "What do you mean a word about the Captain's Chest?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "I know that's an OSA question but seems somewhat relevant to KF."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Oh good, it's not just me."
</p><p>You ask, "Oh, is this the storage on the ship?"
</p><p>Holley says, "ETA on completion."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Yes."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Yea, that's not me or even my team."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Oh, OSA...yeah, not a KF town thing then."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Last I knew, it was in testing in TEST."
</p><p>Holley says, "This is the town to buy ships so peripherally."
</p><p>Erienne says, "It has been for a while, I was just curious if anyone knew if there were new developments on it."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Or any sign of it being released."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "While I understand that this is the launching ground for OSA, KF is not OSA as a whole and we don't provide maintenace or support for it."
</p><p>Holley says, "That was kind of a joke."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Arena in KF.  Pass it on."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "There's an Arena on the Floatilla."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Small one would be fun."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Beach volleyball?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "Kidding."
</p><p>Yardie exclaims, "Bring it here!  KF justice!  Airing of grievances!"
