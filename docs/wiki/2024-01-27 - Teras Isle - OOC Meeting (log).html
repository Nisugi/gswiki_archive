<h2><span id="Player_Comment.2C_Questions.2C_and.2For_Concerns"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Player_Comment,_Questions,_and/or_Concerns">Player Comment, Questions, and/or Concerns</span></h2>
<ul><li>Olivvia asks, "Hi!  Since you said you wanted to eventually have a boss creature here like the Hinterwilds wyrm, does that include plans to add ascension level hunting to Nelemar?"
<ul><li>There are no additional hunting grounds slated for Teras Isle at this time.</li></ul></li>
<li>Perigourd asks, "I am very curious to know what ideas you might be kicking around for a wyrm-like creature?"
<ul><li>Nothing that can be shared at this time.</li></ul></li>
<li>Opalina quietly asks, "Would you be able to share how much time we'd have before the shrine area goes down for repairs?"
<ul><li>The shrine on the River Muagh is not being closed.  The river itself is a permanent addition.</li>
<li>The settlement/ruins area may have areas closed off, to simulate repairs being done to them.</li></ul></li>
<li>Falvicar asks, "From an OOC perspective, it's a safe assumption that the waking of Zerroth is no coincidence given that the source (if you will) came from the Teras.   Given that he's awaken from the activity at Teras, does this mean Dusk Coven activity will happen and potential Ronan warnings?"
<ul><li>No Comment</li></ul></li>
<li>Falvicar says, "The other question I have is are there any plans on trade of Teras to Icemule?  Specifically tobaccos since Pinefar (Icemule) only does cigar tobacco and I believe Teras only does pipe tobacco."
<ul><li>Trade is a topic for Teras right now, but concrete plans have not been made.</li>
<li>Teras and the Landing already have trade agreements.</li>
<li>The Darkstone Bay Consortium has met with the Borthuum Mining Company, for example.</li></ul></li>
<li>Whisker says, "Not really a question. O just wanted to say this guru program so far has been outstanding."</li>
<li>Desorceri asks, "Is there a mascot here?"
<ul><li>The Goose</li></ul></li>
<li>Desorceri asks, "Will/can anything be done about elven bias with regards to the Whining Elf Bar and "ring of figure" mocking elves?"
<ul><li>Yes.  I think that's worth addressing, given how long the place has been around.  It's probably time to correct the record in regards to that, and it fits in the theme of the shops removing their bias</li>
<li>It might be time for some revisions regarding the Whining Elf.  I think we are in a different time, and it could use some adjustments.</li></ul></li>
<li>Desorceri asks, "Ok sorry sidetracked.  Avregol and Nelemar? Have they settled on a truce?"
<ul><li>No Comment</li></ul></li>
<li>Desorceri asks, "Any shop ideas for the new settlement?"
<ul><li>Nothing set in stone, but there is a desire</li></ul></li>
<li>Desorceri asks, "Will there ever been a "Battle of the Isles" between KF and Teras involving a regatta or should players organize that themselves?"
<ul><li>Not something that staff has considered</li></ul></li>
<li>Akaylas says, "Thanks for all the work with the Ragnak Reclamation; I really enjoyed it, despite the crushing sadness I experienced from having to miss its conclusion last night."</li>
<li>Alamany asks, "I guess my questions was sort of answered with the discussions we've been having, but is the new area going to be designed like the outposts around illistim?"
<ul><li>That was the general idea for it, in my vision of Kragnek-Dzu. </li>
<li>A smaller community of dwarves who are living life on their own... between a volcano and the Temple of Luukos.</li>
<li>The layout is a small, settlement-like, area.  Sylvaerrend or Ravelin may be a good example of how it is intended to be presented.</li></ul></li>
<li>Ashleen asks, "With this story line that has been going on. Many players have been bringing resources over to Teras from Landing. Instead of loaded all of us with materials. Can we have like a drop box in landing that will bring the materials here to Teras?"
<ul><li>We can probably do that.</li></ul></li>
<li>Olivvia says, "Just some minor town shop stuff.  But since there are fresh eyes looking at the town, I wanted to point out that the Teras Cobblers' Co-Operative doesn't have customization options for 'a small vial of dye' to access the list of 41 colors available in other town cobbling warehouses, such as the Landing and Cysaegir.  Would it be possible to investigate why this is and fix it?  It's been a longstanding issue for years, but it would be great to be able to purchase dye colors here without traveling elsewhere."
<ul><li>A request for a bug in the shop was asked for so that it could be investigated</li></ul></li>
<li>Olivvia says, "And as a general world storyline question/comment, is the Dusk Coven going to be taunted 24/7 in-game at every storyline this year?  It's pretty disheartening to see this is where things are going this year.  Characters should be able to support their Arkati without being cast as a cliche antagonist and face regular in-game bullying.  The general commentary and attitude in Icemule in particular has gone far beyond IC interaction and moved into blanket character assassination, in my opinion, when people are openly told to unfriend certain characters or disparage them in public for making certain decisions.  I would hate to see this unpleasantness spreading elsewhere as the storylines progress worldwide this year."
<ul><li>No, that is not the intent.</li></ul></li>
<li>Perigourd asks, "The first one was, what does Kragnek mean?"
<ul><li>The Ragnak Clan are known to be the experts on craftsmanship.  It could have something to do with being "elite"... rather than king...</li></ul></li>
<li>Perigourd asks, "Kharam-Dzu I believe is known to have a sizeable giantkin component, did you plan to work up that side of things here as well? or will the town become more Dwarven centric?"
<ul><li>In regards to Kragnek-Dzu?  It will initially be rebuilding the dwarven settlement, and the Ragnak Clan will be shifting back there from Kharam-Dzu.  But, that is sort of the catalyst for tensions easing around the other areas of Kharam-Dzu, regarding the elves for example.   So I think that all fits together.  The settlement itself, I would see no reason why others couldn't be part of their community.  The Ragnak Clan likely respect expert craftsmanship, regardless.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Log">Log</span></h2>
<p>Marstreforn says, "We can start now."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "I mean carry as we were... upstanding individuals that we are."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Perigourd asks, "Olunrok wasn't strong enough, eh?"
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Perigourd asks, "Had to call in the big guns?"
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Desorceri says, "I don't think you want to take that duel."
</p><p>Vaemyr says, "I heard about the zerroth fun."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "So... first I would like to THANK YOU all for coming to the Teras Isle OOC Meeting in 2024.  The players are why I am here in the first place, having been one myself for many, many years."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Too much friendly fire with that duel."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I'd like to get through some formal observations of what has happened on the island since I took over as its guru."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "And then we can chat more about recent happenings."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "You've got some 'splainin to do."
</p><p>Akaylas says, "Doom and gloom upon us."
</p><p>Akaylas says, "Or so I've heard."
</p><p>Desorceri exclaims, "Ok meeting adjourned!"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "There are different parts about being a guru for a town.  Some are a matter of personal taste, while others are a matter of keeping things to a standard across the game."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "So there are elements of what has changed on Teras Isle that match both of those, to an extent."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "First..."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Borthuum Barter Rules.  This was part of a game-wide removal of player-character racial bias when buying/selling to the vendors in town.  I believe this happened in every town."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Everyone gets the same amount when selling, and everyone gets the same deal.  That is how it should be working, so please let me know if it isn't in any shops."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Regarding shops."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The Clerical Supply, Armory, Weaponry, and Locksmith shops were updated to bring things in-line with modern QC standards.  Many items were outdated, and needed to be adjusted.  Some new inventory was added to replace others and offer a different selection of wares."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "This an area where bringing things in line with the rest of the game met with some personal taste."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Some things about Teras Isle were left in disrepair, so I tried to investigate into what those were and to correct certain elements about how they worked."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The Hog s Pen was having some issues with INCANT and was also tossing people in the wrong room under certain circumstances."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That has been fixed."
</p><p>Whisker says, "Aww."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "It was very odd to have CAST and INCANT work differently."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The Glaesen Star s citizens  lounge was reinstated.  Updates to messaging and general movement across the deck were adjusted to fix some strange behaviors while onboard and when the crew needed to toss someone off."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "But it was not all just fixing things that weren't quite right."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "A new fishing dock was constructed near the Brewery on Aquamarine Street, complemented with the fishing supply shop: Borthuum Bargain Bait.  This shop is operated by a new NPC known as Ashley (a barefoot dwarven angler).  Another NPC of note is the goose that pesters anyone spending time at the dock fishing.  Maybe it has a hidden purpose?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The former Meeting Hall was converted to the Borthuum s revised Clan Hall.  Changes included an updated main entrance, a memorial chamber (more on this later), a citizens  nook/workroom for in-town merchanting services, and a viewing area in the amphitheater."
</p><p>Akaylas says, "Someone was just asking me about fishing spots yesterday."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Oh yes!  Did you know that the River Muagh has some of its own unique fish.  And it is also has a few interesting things to catch that might have swam upriver from the Obsidian Sea."
</p><p>Whisker asks, "Really??"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "REALLY."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Ooh."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Nice."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Guess i'll have to pick up angling."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "We'll get more into fishing in a moment!"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Also, early on after taking over as guru for Teras Isle, there were some minor updates to  the appearance of the wandering goose and mule in town."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That covers everything in the first section of the list, regarding What's New in Kharam Dzu."
</p><p>Opalina quietly exclaims, "I missed it all!"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Just a recap of the last year's changes."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "It's on the list."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "There will be a summary probably."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "There will be a summary on the wiki as soon as the meeting is ended."
</p><p>Speaking to Opalina, Falvicar says, "There there.  We can kill Luukos' golems while we are here."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Also, due to some of the changes made that I previously mentioned, I had to "unfix" something else.  so...."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The Gallery Lounge and Ballroom in the museum are still on my plate.  They were interfering with another area of the game that, I felt, really needed to be fixed.  I plan to have those corrected in the near future."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "It's just a couple room descriptions, really.  So not a huge task.  And if anyone enjoys using the lounge and ballroom, where the harpist plays, those will be available again before the middle of the year."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "There is a fountain too!"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Some events that were done in 2023."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Toys are fun!  There was a new raffle event introduced in 2023 for the original volcano toys that can cover you in ash when you feel away from home.  While these apply the same ash as the citizenship pins, they do not require citizenship with Teras Isle to use."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "There are two raffles each year for those toys."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Going back to the Clan Hall, specifically the memorial chamber, this was due to the released lore in the Death in Dwarven Culture doc that GameMaster Netz authored."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I provided some input into the Borthuum Clan honorifics and ceremonial practices."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Invasions!  I enjoy them!  I hope they are appreciated on some level by players as well.  Some themes we saw in 2023 were undead, elementals, and some flying fiery doom birds that may or may not have been inspired by someone cooking a turkey for too long at some point during the year."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "It wasn't me!  I'm not a turkey burner."
</p><p>Vaemyr says, "Uh huh..."
</p><p>Vaemyr says, "Believable."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "My use of lavabombs recently doesn't really coincide with that claim though."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "In 2024, a short storyline called Ragnak Reclamation has stirred things up on the island.  The Ragnak Clan s former settlement, Kragnek-Dzu, has been reclaimed (mostly) and a rebuilding process has begun.  There will be more on that throughout the first quarter of 2024, but the main storyline has come to completion."
</p><p>Akaylas says, "Boo lavabombs."
</p><p>Speaking to Akaylas, Perigourd says, "I don't mind them."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Kinda a quaint quirk here on Teras."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "There may be extenuating circumstances that spiraled off of the conclusion last evening."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I've working with GameMaster Auchand on those details."
</p><p>Speaking to Akaylas, Desorceri says, "Occupational hazards."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The River Muagh is a permanently traversable addition to Teras Isle.  The Kragnek-Dzu ruins are currently explorable, but will soon be going under repairs.  Expect to see various changes in accessibility to players as well as updates to its appearance as repairs are underway."
</p><p>Akaylas says, "I caught one too head a couple weeks ago, so forgive me if that colors my demeanor."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "While the V tullian threat seems to be recently vanquished, there is a new shrine dedicated to V tull near the mouth of the river.  The river s mouth is wide and mostly unexplored, and recent eruption events have caused part of the cliffs to be more revealed.  It may have also been a possible landing point for the V tullian gigas to stage their initial assault.  Clerics of V tull may now enjoy use of the shrine: Bloodied Cave."
</p><p>Alamany says, "As long as they dont get ambushed."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "I think 99% of the time they'll just get murdred as tribute."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "So we're good."
</p><p>Opalina quietly asks, "How much time do we get to explore before repairs go underway?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That brings me to other fun things that are going to happen FOR SURE on Teras this year."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "Save questions for question and answer time!"
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "Planned for 2024 on Teras Isle, other than the aforementioned reconstruction of Kragnek-Dzu, is the ALE FESTIVAL!  WOOHOOOOO!  And a fishing tournament!?  YESSSS!!!"
</p><p>Ashleen says, "Nice."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I'm still working out a few details with the fishing tournament, but it will likely be during or after the Ale Festival."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Sounds fun."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "June 21st - 23rd for the Ale Festival."
</p><p>Ashleen asks, "Kegs around the Realm?"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Our very own St Patrick's Day."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "Ale Festival will be so much fun!"
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "It's like Octoberfest in June!"
</p><p>Speaking to Desorceri, Akaylas says, "Or maybe the idiotarod."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Ale and fire go well together."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Oh even better."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "Ale and fishing do too!"
</p><p>Vaemyr says, "Especially in the middle of summer hah."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Perigourd says, "And fire and fish."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "You like fire a lot, don't you?"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "It's a trifecta."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Falvicar says, "Us Mulers do drinks and fishing too."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Stein hoisting, best beard competition, etc."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Perigourd says, "Not as much as Raelee."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "But close."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Those are the PLANNED things for Teras.  But I have some ideas kicking around as well."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "These are potential things that could happen in 2024, but I can t make any promises on them yet.  These include a further expansion to the raft system, where you may be able to traverse along the northward coastline of Teras Isle."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "It could have a dangerous area!"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I would also like Teras to have a realm boss similar to the Hinterwild s wyrm, but with more of a Terasian flavor to it (and potentially not even a wyrm)."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Ooh."
</p><p>Vaemyr says, "A fire wyrm."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "These are just really tip of the brain ideas for now."
</p><p>Desorceri exclaims, "The dreaded giant lavamole!"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "So much possibility there."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I would also like to expand on the lore of Kragnek-Dzu, and the V tullian shrine since players seem to want to know more about those."
</p><p>Whisker says, "Mebbe a escaped inmate from the Asylum."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "And finally, a potentially not even 2024 idea is to do a mini-quest for Teras Isle in the same vein as Reim is to Icemule Trace.  I ve given that idea the name of  The Terror of Teras Isle  for now, but it s really just a concept for now, with not many details that I m willing to share otherwise."
</p><p>Ashleen says, "Glad we are bringing a little more action to Teras."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Wow."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That is a very long-term goal that may not see traction in 2024."
</p><p>Ashleen says, "That would be awesome."
</p><p>Vaemyr says, "Sounds very neat."
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "The floor is lava?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I will need to have a much larger conversation before anything like that is considered, but it's something I'd like to do eventually."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Something post cap on teras would be great."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Loving all the creativity and passion, thank you."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "So, those are what has happened in 2023, and in 2024, some upcoming plans for 2024 that are already in motion, as well as some ideas for my projects in the later half of 2024."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Now..."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "If all 40 of you could sign up please."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "If you have questions, of course."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hi Olivvia."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "You are first, if you'd like to ask your question(s)."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "JOIN the list if you want to add yourself to it."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Oh."
</p><p>Olivvia asks, "Hi!  Since you said you wanted to eventually have a boss creature here like the Hinterwilds wyrm, does that include plans to add ascension level hunting to Nelemar?"
</p><p>Ashleen says, "Thanks."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I can answer that."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That isn't in the scope of my plans.  I have to defer to... yes."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "There are no additional hunting grounds slated for Teras Isle at this time."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "Did you have another question?"
</p><p>Olivvia says, "No, that's all."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hi Perigourd."
</p><p>Perigourd exclaims, "Hello!"
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "You had a question for me?"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Mine was going to be similar to Olivvia's, actually."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "I would like to say though that I thoroughly enjoyed the parts of the Reclamatnion storyline."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Those that I could make, at any rate."
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "I am very curious to know what ideas you might be kicking around for a wyrm-like creature?"
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "And if you meant the wyrm base, or an actual wyrm?"
</p><p>Olivvia says, "Look what a can of wyrms you opened."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I have no details on any of that.  Sorry."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Perigourd says, "Worth a try."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Perigourd says, "That's all I had outside of saying that I'm excited to see Teras getting a lot of love."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "It's great to see actual regular activity here again."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "It's something I'd like to happen, as a guru for the island.  I can't say if it is going to occur or not."
</p><p>Ashleen says, "Hopefully we have less zombies."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "Did you have any other questions for me, Perigourd?"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Nope, I'm good. Thank you."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hi Opalina."
</p><p>Opalina quietly exclaims, "Hi!"
</p><p>Olivvia asks, "Can I join the list again at the end if I thought of another question?"
</p><p>Olivvia says, "Ah."
</p><p>Speaking to Olivvia, you exclaim, "I guess you figured it out!"
</p><p>Opalina quietly asks, "Would you be able to share how much time we'd have before the shrine area goes down for repairs?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The shrine on the River Muagh is not being closed.  The river itself is a permanent addition."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The settlement/ruins area may have areas closed off, to simulate repairs being done to them."
</p><p>Opalina quietly says, "Oh see I got confused there."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "And will eventually use components donated by players when I try to incorporate what was used to help rebuild it with Gamordi and his clan."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Other than the staples being provided for by the Borthuum clan."
</p><p>You joke, "Make sure that it takes a lot of wood and stuff, or Perigourd will rebuild it in a night."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "A wall of acorns!"
</p><p>Falvicar says, "Awww.. so way to see it."
</p><p>Olivvia exclaims, "I heard there was eonake and heavy metal donated!"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "I do keep many in my kit."
</p><p>Opalina quietly says, "Well, Thank you Marstreforn that was all my questions at this time."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Alrighty."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hi Whisker."
</p><p>Falvicar says, "Oof."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I am ready for your question."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "He has to consult the beard kobold."
</p><p>Whisker says, "Not really a question. O just wanted to say this guru program so far has been outstanding."
</p><p>Whisker says, "Im biased to Teras and Zul."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "Dwarves are the best."
</p><p>Whisker says, "But am really impressed by what everything thats been done."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I agree, that it is important to have people who are passionate about what they are doing on both sides of the coin.  As a GameMaster, you have to really put yourself in the shoes of the player sometimes.  It's not always easy, but I do often find myself thinking of how I'd see it from the eyes of different characters and how certain elements that occur in one town could affect another in the same region."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "And as a player, I suspect you wonder what could possibly be going on the head of a GameMaster, for them to come up with some of the things we do."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "But the players can be, and are, equally passionate about things in the game.  It's a symbiotic relationship."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I just hope that people can be honest, and open with me, so I know if something is not going well for them or if there is room for improvement."
</p><p>Ashleen says, "We can make sure that happens."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "I appreciate that you are inclusive of everyone who shows up and have been calendaring all your events so people can participate.  It helps a lot to be able to feel involved."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I also hope that my childish nature doesn't hurt anyone's feelings.  I'm kind of a kid, when it comes down to playing games, even as a GameMaster."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "Dwarves are generally friendly and I really enjoy that."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Falvicar says, "Something tells me you're safe in that regard."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I promise I don't look at it like a game of PacMan and I'm trying to eat all the dots before the ghosts turn against me."
</p><p>Opalina quietly says, "It was such an awesome vision."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "That was so specific now I think you do."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Maybe."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Maybe not."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "Whisker, did you have any other questions for me?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hi Falvicar."
</p><p>Whisker says, "We're gud."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Falvicar asks, "Hi.  Come here often?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The golems are flying off the shelf."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Falvicar says, "I"ve a few questions if you dont mind."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Sure."
</p><p>Falvicar asks, "From an OOC perspective, it's a safe assumption that the waking of Zerroth is no coincidence given that the source (if you will) came from the Teras.   Given that he's awaken from the activity at Teras, does this mean Dusk Coven activity will happen and potential Ronan warnings?"
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "No comment!"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Womp wahh."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I have to admit that I thought Perigourd was going to ask that."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Falvicar says, "Leave it to me."
</p><p>Falvicar says, "Just like finding bugs."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "What is this Dusk... Coven?"
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Falvicar says, "Evil evil peoples."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I'm told it requires a spray bottle."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "SUUURE."
</p><p>Falvicar says, "'that need killing."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "I need to make a script for that question."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "And just update it each piece at a time."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "He's not being serious."
</p><p>Falvicar says, "I figured he's not being serious."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "You had another question?"
</p><p>Falvicar says, "So if no comment on that, then I've another question."
</p><p>Falvicar says, "The other question I have is are there any plans on trade of Teras to Icemule?  Specifically tobaccos since Pinefar (Icemule) only does cigar tobacco and I believe Teras only does pipe tobacco."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I believe Zul Logoth cornered that Market last year."
</p><p>Falvicar asks, "Ohh?"
</p><p>You ask, "Didn't they start a trade with IMT over tobacco?"
</p><p>Whisker says, "Coldleaf tobacco deal."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I want to say in the summer or fall."
</p><p>Opalina quietly says, "Coldleaf for metals."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That's an interesting question.  I've considered what trade might look like, moving forward, regarding Teras Isle.  Not likely with anything of that sort, however.  I'm AM looking at other aspects of that, regarding trade.  But it's all just scribbles on paper for now."
</p><p>Perigourd exclaims, "Oh!"
</p><p>Falvicar says, "I just find it interesting that there's different tobacco types.  one for cigar and other for pipes and surprrised they dont work together."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "There has been some trade between Kharam-Dzu and Wehnimer's Landing already."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The Darkstone Bay Consortium has met with the Borthuum Company Store, for example."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Borthuum Mining Company, at large, actually.  Correction of the record."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Vaemyr says, "And indirectly up to icemule I guess too haha, since a lot of that Glaes ended up in the crystal hall."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Not just the store."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "We should suggest a tobacco maker, and new tobacco foragables."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "Yes!"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That did happen."
</p><p>Falvicar says, "That's all I have.  I'll dart away before I think up more questions."
</p><p>Speaking to Falvicar, Akaylas says, "I wouldn't smoke cigar tabacco in a pipe unless you want a stinky pipe."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Thank you for the questions."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hi Desorceri."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Hiya."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "I see you've a question for me.  What's on your mind?"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "I have a few... questionable wants."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "Requests?"
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Is there a mascot here?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The goose is considered somewhat of a mascot."
</p><p>Whisker asks, "The mule?"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Not as good as an otter but it checks the box."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "A mule isn't a goose!  The mule could be, I guess.  BUT it's not a goose!"
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Will/can anything be done about elven bias with regards to the Whining Elf Bar and "ring of figure" mocking elves?"
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "Maybe we could turn the if you cross a mule and a goose, do you get a moose?"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "A very loud wake up call."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Island Moose."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Heee hoooonk."
</p><p>Opalina quietly says, "I hear Moose are pretty tough critters. I'd not want to cross one."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Flying Island Goose-billed Moose."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "If you get it tattooed on your permanently we'll consider it."
</p><p>Ashleen says, "Can do better than that."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Your back."
</p><p>Speaking to Desorceri, Marstreforn asks, "Did you have another question?"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Gmoose, no silent letters, no silence ever."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "First we'd need dwarves to be able to ride moose."
</p><p>You ask, "Is this the moose thing still or the question about prejudices?"
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "I think it's the moose thing?"
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Did I miss your response to elves?"
</p><p>You ask, "Did you see his question about the Elf prejudices?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Oh the bar."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Or rather mocking"."
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Will/can anything be done about elven bias with regards to the Whining Elf Bar and "ring of figure" mocking elves?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Sorry, I just rewound and saw it."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Figures, that is."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Yes.  I think that's worth addressing, given how long the place has been around.  It's probably time to correct the record in regards to that, and it fits in the theme of the shops removing their bias."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Would love to not get kicked out but treated poorly like a "Karen's Diner"."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I'll look into the bar a bit and see what decisions I can make regarding it."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "And the ring of figures by the bridge please."
</p><p>Whisker says, "Whumpy will kick anyone out for misbehaving."
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Will we see a return of Avregol and/or Nelemar?"
</p><p>Xynwen says, "I think an elf should buy it, keep the name, but make it specifically about his greatest rival who whined every time the owner beat him to something special.  You can have a dartboard with the whining elf's face on it, and elves and dwarves gambling and mocking one another in good fun instead."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "You can explain away anything with the right lore."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Xynwen, Opalina says, "You've put some thought into that."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Whining elf ale, charge double for half."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "It might be time for some revisions regarding the Whining Elf.  I think we are in a different time, and it could use some adjustments."
</p><p>Ashleen says, "Darts are always a good thing to have.. no matter whose face is on it."
</p><p>Opalina quietly says, "Maybe a half-elf can buy it .. and constantly battle with him/herself."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "And it doesn't make sense for a group of people to be taunting someone 24/7 in the streets."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Darts need a happy hour where you don't require the 4 player audience in some bars."
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Ok sorry sidetracked.  Avregol and Nelemar? Have they settled on a truce?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "It isn't really a message I think we need to convey as being the "normal" for Teras Isle, either way.  Kharam-Dzu is a fairly large town, even if the island is sort of small in the scope of the game compared to how connected all the other towns are."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "It would make sense that there is more room for everyone there now, especially given that the Ragnak clan will be having their own settlement to move into soon."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Good questions.  Thank you."
</p><p>You ask, "Did you see this one?"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Desorceri asks, "Ok sorry sidetracked.  Avregol and Nelemar? Have they settled on a truce?"."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I can't comment on the elementals."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Ok two more sorry."
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "Did Avregol survive the Fier'dracus being shattered?"
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "I can't comment on the elementals!"
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Any shop ideas for the new settlement?"
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Perigourd says, "This was for him."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "Oh!"
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Desorceri says, "I can't recall."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I am still pondering a few things for Kragnek-Dzu.  I would like to have some sort of shop there.  The details are not entirely set in stone on what could happen there in the future."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Was eons ago but it left a positive mark on my love for Teras."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Thanks."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Ok last one."
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Will there ever been a "Battle of the Isles" between KF and Teras involing a regatta or should players organize that themselves?"
</p><p>Akaylas says, "You did it."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "We all know who would win that."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Desorceri, Opalina says, "Looks like we are on our own for that one."
</p><p>Desorceri exclaims, "Look there's more room!"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "But I have not considered that."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "No."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Okay."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Desorceri says, "Thank you for your guruship!  The defense rests."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Thank you for the questions."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hi Akaylas."
</p><p>Akaylas says, "Hello to you too."
</p><p>Akaylas says, "My questions were answered previously, but..."
</p><p>Akaylas says, "Thanks for all the work with the Ragnak Reclamation; I really enjoyed it, despite the crushing sadness I experienced from having to miss its conclusion last night."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I thought I saw you pop in."
</p><p>Akaylas says, "I did; work got in the way."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "Ah!"
</p><p>Akaylas says, "I sort of unceremoniously disappeared while Desorceri was dragging me around."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hard to track everyone and everything in the chaos of battle sometimes."
</p><p>Akaylas says, "Anywa, it was fun, first time being on the ground floor for a storyline."
</p><p>Akaylas exclaims, "That's all from me; thanks for all the contributions and keep up the great work!"
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "I am super glad you enjoyed it!"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "It was a lot of fun for me as well."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Ash cloud travel at the next RW!  You arrive fast but completely immolated."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Heh."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I like to put some thought into how I involve the players in different ways in a storyline.  While combat is a big part of the game, and it has a place, there are other elements to consider when players are investing into a storyline.  Providing something that can help develop a character is another component I really consider."
</p><p>Speaking to Desorceri, Perigourd says, "My horse seems to swim pretty fast as is."
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Desorceri exclaims, "That's a hippocampus in disguise!"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Helping the dwarves rebuild, for example."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "I like that you provide ways for people to catch up and be involved at every session, even if they couldn't make it to the previous one."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "It's the small things."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Good to know.  I'll try to keep that as a common element in the future."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "The Prince Voregrek and Gamordi recap at the beginning is very helpful."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "The formatting was pretty stellar."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hi Alamany."
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "The prince is alright then?"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Yeah he checked out after agreeing to rebuild."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Hi."
</p><p>Desorceri exclaims, "Storms a brewin, I drink ale, bye!"
</p><p>Speaking to Alamany, Marstreforn asks, "Did you have a question for me?"
</p><p>Alamany asks, "I guess my questions was sort of answered with the discussions we've been having, but is the new area going to be designed like the outposts around illistim?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hmmm."
</p><p>Alamany says, "With npcs, shops etc."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Marstreforn asks, "I don't think I can really say for sure at this time?"
</p><p>You ask, "Do you mean like Sylvaerrend and Ravelin?"
</p><p>Alamany says, "Or like whistler's post, etc."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That was the general idea for it, in my vision of Kragnek-Dzu.  A smaller community of dwarves who are living life on their own... between a volcano and the Temple of Luukos.  Good on them."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Err pass."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The layout is a small, settlement-like, area.  Sylvaerrend or Ravelin may be a good example of how it is intended to be presented."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "How exciting."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I don't want to say there are going to be similarities or not, but the scope is generally like those area."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "That fountain needs cleanup before Trallihn finds a new home."
</p><p>Speaking to Alamany, Marstreforn asks, "Good question!  Did you have any others?"
</p><p>Alamany says, "This is more of a general request for everyone here, but as someone with a vtullian cleric, i could use some input on how to play towards that side of things."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "If you aren't on Discord, you may wish to join."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Not trying to go around and attacking folks during an invasion."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "You want advice on how to play a V'tullian priest from me?"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "There's an excellent RP channel there."
</p><p>Alamany says, "I am."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "I don't think you'd have to."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "There's also the challenge verb."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I think I would have to recommend getting insight from your fellow players."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Those who are interested in combating you are given a clear request to accept or decline."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Mars used it on me actually."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Yeah there's a roleplaying channel on Discord that will be helpful."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "V'tull isn't especially one-sided when it comes to who needs to die in an invasion."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "But bearing witness to bloodshed in general appeases V'tull."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Or furthering combat, war, etc."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Lots of roads you could choose to play out there."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "I think his motto is "Who's blood? Who cares!"."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That is a better conversation outside of this venue, probably.  However, there is the new shrine so you are welcome to use that as a place to roleplay to your heart's content."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Prepare to die there is all I know."
</p><p>Speaking to Alamany, Marstreforn asks, "Was there another question?"
</p><p>Alamany says, "No thats it, thanks."
</p><p>Whisker says, "V' tull has presence in the cleric guild as well."
</p><p>Speaking to Alamany, Marstreforn says, "Thank you for being part of the fun."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hi Ashleen."
</p><p>Ashleen says, "Hey."
</p><p>Ashleen asks, "With this story line that has been going on. Many players have been bringing resources over to Teras from Landing. Instead of loaded all of us with materials. Can we have like a drop box in landing that will bring the materials here to Teras?"
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "A donation bin of sorts?"
</p><p>Olivvia says, "You could mail them to someone on Teras who will deliver them."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I believe Gamordi offered that option if you wanted to."
</p><p>Ashleen asks, "To mail things to him?"
</p><p>Ashleen asks, "Can we mail logs, or 75lbs of invar?"
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "Good question!"
</p><p>Ashleen says, "No knows what is next he will ask for."
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "I don't believe weight is a factor as much as item count?"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "I've mailed lots of heavy weaponry at any rate."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "It's only items that matter."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I'm not sure what the maximum capacity is for a package."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "Well, the packages hold 100 lbs, actually I believe, but other than that it's an item limit."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "You can send multiple packages though."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I think 5-6 a package."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Up to 9 objects of 100 pounds total, based on this one."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Nice... glad we don't charge for oversized/overweight shipping here."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Like your typical box you loot from stuff, for the most part."
</p><p>Ashleen says, "But a bin would be nice, and have a carrier bring it over, instead of paying to mail something to him. Especially a lot of items."
</p><p>Opalina quietly says, "What a great solution."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Maybe not.  But... yes a bin is something I could do.  I'll talk with some of the other GameMasters to see what the best solution is."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "I'm ready to raid playershops for ores to help unless there's a cheaper way.  I'm not the forging type."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Once I've figured that out, I'm sure Gamordi will let everyone in town know."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Its those elf arms."
</p><p>Ashleen says, "Citan did that with invar and melted down 75lbs worth."
</p><p>Speaking to Ashleen, Marstreforn asks, "Did you have another question?"
</p><p>Ashleen says, "No, thank you all for your time."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "You are welcome."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "It's you again!"
</p><p>Olivvia exclaims, "It is!"
</p><p>Olivvia says, "Just some minor town shop stuff.  But since there are fresh eyes looking at the town, I wanted to point out that the Teras Cobblers' Co-Operative doesn't have customization options for 'a small vial of dye' to access the list of 41 colors available in other town cobbling warehouses, such as the Landing and Cysaegir.  Would it be possible to investigate why this is and fix it?  It's been a longstanding issue for years, but it would be great to be able to purchase dye colors here without traveling elsewhere."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Hmmm."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "Can you do me a favor and BUG the room that is suppose to work in?"
</p><p>Olivvia says, "I'll do that after."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I've gone through every bug report for Teras so far and I didn't see one for that."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "So I can check into that more if I get more information about the room."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "I believe it was bugged years ago, and brought up at past OOC meetings, but since nothing happened it fell by the wayside."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "I will do that."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "And as a general world storyline question/comment, is the Dusk Coven going to be taunted 24/7 in-game at every storyline this year?  It's pretty disheartening to see this is where things are going this year.  Characters should be able to support their Arkati without being cast as a cliche antagonist and face regular in-game bullying.  The general commentary and attitude in Icemule in particular has gone far beyond IC interaction and moved into blanket character assassination, in my opinion, when people are openly told to unfriend certain characters or disparage them in public for making certain decisions.  I would hate to see this unpleasantness spreading elsewhere as the storylines progress worldwide this year."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I'll keep an eye out for it, and I've got what you said here to refer back to."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I don't know anything about the Dusk Coven, or how it will play out... if it even does."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That's outside my general scope of influence."
</p><p>You ask, "Did I miss a question?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "She asked about the Dusk Coven being taunted in every storyline."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Ooh, I was scrolled up."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "No, the Dusk Coven isn't going to be taunted at every storyline."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I would hope not.  I really haven't seen myself being involved in anything they've done so far."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I'm going to guess that there is a blanket assumption that what happened with Zerroth was tied to them."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I feel like they are being blamed for more than we have set them up to be at fault for."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Oh, no..."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "No, I'm referring to events prior to Zerroth, but since there are comments made attributing Zerroth to them, it got me concerned."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Perigourd says, "That's partly because not many knew what was going on here on Teras, honestly."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "Because inclusive storylines like the ones on Teras are what interest me."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "The last few Icemule meetings were really unpleasant."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "What happened with the Ragnak Reclamation storyline was a purely V'tullian effort... it has a cliffhanger for left open because the GameMaster who plays Zerroth wanted him unleashed."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That's about all I'm giving on that."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Ooh."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Marstreforn you keep throwing out crumbs."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "I think the assumption comes from the vision Ronan sent one of the Icemule characters denoting what looked like five pillars."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Beyond that, whatever happens... happens."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "The dusk coven has three known antagonists."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I can't really say what that GameMaster will do."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "So folk are looking to figure out the other two."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I'm fairly certain, and I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong, Zerroth had a history with Teras."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Yeah, his forces occupied it during another storyline (spoilers)."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I remember."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "The point is, that's why it was easy to tie here."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Yep."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "But no, that isn't the intent."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Though, I suppose people are welcome to scape goat them if they want to."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I have no idea what is in store for Zerroth beyond his release."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That's kind of the fun for me too."
</p><p>Speaking to Olivvia, Marstreforn asks, "Did you have another question?"
</p><p>Olivvia says, "Oh, no, that was it."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Olivvia exclaims, "Thank you!"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Perigourd, hello again."
</p><p>Perigourd exclaims, "Hi!"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "I had two questions."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Sure."
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "The first one was, what does Kragnek mean?"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Kharam-dzu is the city of kings with Dzu meaning kings, from what I understand."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Perigourd says, "I tried to look up a Dwarven lexicon but couldn't find one."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Https://gswiki.play.net/Dwarven_Lexicon."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Not everything has full definitions, since we didn't always find them in original documentation, but it just means we have more leeway/fun to have."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That's a great question, actually!  The name was not created by me, but I felt like there was something to use with the little information that was available on it.  Because there was less than a full paragraph regarding the place, and it apparently existed on Teras Isle at one point, I felt like it was a good foundation for a discoverable area along the River Muagh."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The river was my initial project goal, but the settlement sprouted from it."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "And then the storyline to tie stuff in."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "It was all a process, really."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "The Lexcicon makes it look like an amalgamation of eating and carving."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Lexicon rather."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "The second question I had was..."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I'm sorry that doesn't really answer your question about dwarven language."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Perigourd says, "It gives me more to go on at any rate."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "The Ragnak Clan are known to be the experts on craftsmanship.  It could have something to do with being "elite"... rather than king..."
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "Kharam-Dzu I believe is known to have a sizeable giantkin component, did you plan to work up that side of things here as well? or will the town become more Dwarven centric?"
</p><p>Opalina quietly says, "Thank you so much for this. Im sorry I need to step away."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "In regards to Kragnek-Dzu?  It will initially be rebuilding the dwarven settlement, and the Ragnak Clan will be shifting back there from Kharam-Dzu.  But, that is sort of the catalyst for tensions easing around the other areas of Kharam-Dzu, regarding the elves for example.   So I think that all fits together.  The settlement itself, I would see no reason why others couldn't be part of their community.  The Ragnak Clan likely respect expert craftsmanship, regardless."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I think he meant....."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "Oh in regards to storyline stuff in general?"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Do you intend to have a sizeable giantkin presence here since its in the lore documents."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Ah, right."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Perigourd says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "It isn't something we've discussed yet."
</p><p>Akaylas says, "I too have to depart; thanks again for holding this forum and providing these insights; excited for what 2024 holds."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "But I can say as the Giantkin Guru that I'd love to have more spots where you see the clans in a natural setting."
</p><p>Ashleen says, "Pardon me, I am sorry, but my attention is needed elsewhere. Thank  you ahain for this information."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "While that's a great ideal, it can be had to implement."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I see no reason why I couldn't incorporate that more."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "If it's aright with the guru."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "That's all I had."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Maybe this helps?  https://gswiki.play.net/Library_Mouse."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "It is, of course."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Maybe not as a full on clan presence, or settlement, but to have more of an NPC presence regarding giantman people in the town overall."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "That would be fun."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Kha is referenced as rune it seems."
</p><p>Desorceri asks, "Dzu is king?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Elite or king.  highest of."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "That is what I remember, anyway."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "But I am not sure what is official."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Perhaps that is something I can consider working on, as the dwarf guru."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Too many kings ruin the turnip soup."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Desorceri says, "Yeah mull it over and let us know."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I can do that."
</p><p>Marstreforn asks, "Did anyone have questions?"
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Perigourd says, "Start with the dwarven swears."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I think that wraps it up."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Olivvia asks, "Will Gamordi share the turnip soup in the Clan Hall?"
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "Thank you everyone!"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Appreciate the time from all of you."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "Ginaven makes the soup, Gamordi just eats it."
</p><p>Marstreforn exclaims, "Maybe there can be a soup-off!"
</p><p>Desorceri exclaims, "During a regatta!"
</p><p>Olivvia says, "Thank you for sharing your ideas and excitement with us today."
</p><p>Alamany says, "Soup is definitely ideal for teras climate."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Soul and Sails Fest."
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "I am glad you all came."
</p><p>Whisker exclaims, "Time to fish the river!"
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Oops Soup and Sails."
</p><p>Speaking to Whisker, Desorceri says, "Whatever you find... I lost it."
</p><p>Vaemyr says, "Glad to hear about all the different stuff."
</p><p>Speaking to Whisker, Perigourd says, "As long as you don't become the bait."
</p><p>Desorceri says, "Yeah that river fishing has me intringued."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Still need to figure out what Kraken whomp is."
</p><p>Olivvia says, "If anyone finds rare fish, let us know."
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Desorceri asks, "Da wha?"
