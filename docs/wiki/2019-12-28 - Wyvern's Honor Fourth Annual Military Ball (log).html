Speaking softly to you, Tabubu says, "Good evening."

Tabubu nods in greeting to you.

Rulli uncertainly says, "This seemed the most romantic of them all."

Rulli says, "At least to me."

Ithilwyn smiles.

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

Rulli says, "There are refreshments on the cart if you're a tad munchie."

High Lady Avawren just arrived.

Ithilwyn smiles.

You nod to Avawren in greeting.

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Speaking in Elven, you cheerfully say, "Good evening."

Avawren smiles.

Speaking softly to Avawren, Ithilwyn says, "You are a vision."

Rulli bows to Avawren.

Ithilwyn smiles at Avawren.

Speaking in Elven, Avawren says, "Good evening, everyone."

Avawren flushes slightly, some color reaching her cheeks.

Speaking in Elven to Avawren, you say, "Indeed, that gown is amazing."

Speaking to Avawren, Rulli compliments, "You look lovely this fine evening, miss."

Speaking softly to Rulli, Tabubu says, "I think each culture has a different view of romance."

Tabubu nods to Avawren in greeting.

Rulli agrees with Tabubu.

Ithilwyn smiles at Tabubu.

Speaking in Elven, Avawren says, "You all are too kind, thank you."

The musicians end on a soft and gentle note.

Speaking awkwardly to Tabubu, Rulli says, "I had begun to explore such a thing with a lovely Ardenai, but seems she had to leave before long."

Speaking in Elven to Ithilwyn, Avawren says, "Your shoes are a delight."

Speaking to Tabubu, Rulli says, "I remembered her favorite treats and picked them out without realizing it."

Speaking softly to Avawren, Ithilwyn says, "Thank you!  I'm not quite used to having such flashy feet."

Ithilwyn blushes a nice shade of light pink.

Avawren grins at Ithilwyn.

Speaking softly to Rulli, Ithilwyn says, "Now that is love."

Ithilwyn smiles at Rulli.

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Rulli smiles at Ithilwyn.

Tabubu gazes with interest at a bright copper cart.

Speaking to Ithilwyn, Rulli says, "Thank you. I'll recover, eventually I'm sure."

Tabubu softly asks, "No blood wine?"

Rulli looks over at Tabubu and shakes his head.

Tabubu softly says, "I am truely far from home."

Speaking softly to Rulli, Ithilwyn says, "The pain does ease after a while."

Tabubu sighs.

Ithilwyn smiles at Rulli.

Speaking to Tabubu, Rulli says, "I'm not sure I saw it as something offered."

The music seems to wind on forever, bringing old memories and thoughts long forgotten to the surface of your mind.

Speaking softly to Ithilwyn, Rulli says, "I hope so. It's a bit more difficult than I imagined it would be."

Speaking softly to Rulli, Ithilwyn says, "I promise it will."

Ithilwyn smiles at Rulli.

Avawren pours herself a goblet of rich purple shiraz.

The soft melodies of a silver-stringed harp and an alto recorder fill the evening air as the musicians begin a song echoing the soft breezes of spring.

Rulli smiles at Ithilwyn.

Tabubu glances between Ithilwyn and Rulli.

Speaking to Ithilwyn, Rulli says, "Thank you."

Ithilwyn nods at Rulli.

Tabubu stares intently at a bright copper cart and creases her brow in deep thought.

Ithilwyn softly says, "I didn't mean to kill the conversation."

Ithilwyn blushes a nice shade of light pink.

The group finishes the music and pauses to let the listeners chat a bit.

Rulli chuckles.

Rulli says, "Not at all."

Tabubu helps herself to a handful of chocolate-dipped blueberries.

Speaking politely in Elven to you, Avawren says, "You've outdone yourself with the food selection."

Avawren appears to be trying hard not to grin.

Tabubu briefly draws down the edges of her black wool cowl.

Tabubu takes a bite of her dipped blueberries.

Tabubu licks her lips.

You glance at Rulli.

Lord Legionnaire Commander Jaranzair just arrived.

Speaking in Elven to Avawren, you say, "Indeed he did."

Ithilwyn snaps to attention and crisply strikes her chest with a closed fist in a display of respect to Jaranzair.

Rulli turns toward Jaranzair and renders a sharp hand salute.

You incline your head.

Speaking in Elven, Jaranzair says, "Good evening."

Avawren curtsies politely to Jaranzair.

Jaranzair surveys the area.

Jaranzair nods in greeting.

Speaking softly to Jaranzair, Ithilwyn says, "Good evening, sir."

Jaranzair nods once.

The musicians end on a soft and gentle note.

Jaranzair turns sharply on his heel, reversing direction with military precision.

Lord Legionnaire Commander Jaranzair just went out.

Tabubu glances out.

Tabubu ponders.

Ithilwyn sighs happily.

Avawren's face turns slightly pale.

Ithilwyn grins at Avawren.

Rulli recites:


    "We, the members of the Wyvern's Honor and Crimson Legion Reserves would like to welcome everyone this evening to the fourth annual military ball."


The soft melodies of a silver-stringed harp and an alto recorder fill the evening air as the musicians begin a song echoing the soft breezes of spring.

Rulli recites:


    "We are pleased and honored to keep this wonderful tradition. Should the King attend, we'd like to remind everyone to sheathe all weapons in his presence.  That being said, please enjoy the music, the food, and the drink.  Thank you."


Avawren grins at Rulli.

Rulli bows.

Ithilwyn smiles.

Lacing her fingers together, Tabubu's body stiffens as she listens quietly.

The group finishes the music and pauses to let the listeners chat a bit.

You feel at full magical power again.

Speaking in Elven, you say, "My sovereign."

<span style="color:red">Avawren bows her head slightly toward Qalinor as she drops into a deep, respectful curtsy before him.</span>

<span style="color:red">You snap to attention and crisply strike your chest with a closed fist in a display of respect to Qalinor.</span>

Rulli nods at Tabubu.

Orssus just arrived.

<span style="color:red">Qalinor says, "Evening everyone.  What a pleasure it is to see this ball continuing." </span>

<span style="color:red">Qalinor smiles. </span>

You lightly jostle the sides of your marbrinus gown with your fingertips, the metallic threadwork glistening in a brilliant cascade that flows towards the lower hem.

Avawren smiles at Orssus.

You are now speaking Common.

You nod to Orssus in greeting.

<span style="color:red">Qalinor says, "There are few causes more worthy than those that defend our home." </span>

Ithilwyn smiles.

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Rulli, Qalinor says, "I received the invitation, thank you for considering me." </span>

<span style="color:red">Speaking humbly to Qalinor, Rulli says, "Good evening, My Soveriegn. I'm glad it reached you and you were able to make it." </span>

<span style="color:red">Qalinor nods at Orssus. </span>

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Orssus, Qalinor asks, "Evening.  Enjoying the relative peace?" </span>

Orssus says, "Always bandits in the wilds to take care of."

<span style="color:red">Qalinor nods. </span>

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

<span style="color:red">Qalinor says, "True, there is always something to look after." </span>

Orssus says, "But enjoying the quiet from time to time, yes."

Tabubu hums distractedly to herself.

You pour yourself a flute of rose-infused champagne.

Speaking to Orssus, Avawren says, "You and Krystalena do an admirable job keeping the old road travelable."

Avawren smiles at Orssus.

You shift your weight.

Orssus chuckles.

The musicians strike up an old romantic ballad.

The musicians end on a soft and gentle note.

Speaking politely to Rulli, Avawren asks, "I apologize, if we have been introduced, I'm afraid I have forgotten your name?"

Rulli chuckles.

Speaking to Avawren, Rulli says, "We met, but it has been some time."

Speaking to Avawren, Orssus says, "Thank you, I've always somewhat enjoyed cleaning up bandit gangs."

Avawren looks less calm and refreshed than a moment ago.

Speaking politely to Avawren, Rulli introduces, "I am Rulli Ralael.  You might also see my identical twin brother Noak."

The musicians strike up an old romantic ballad.

You say, "So. You ll look so lovely this evening. I don't think it's going to rain on our parade. But that's all right since there is no parade and all."

Rulli bows to Avawren.

You stare at nothing in particular.

Ithilwyn grins at you.

Avawren laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.

Heavy sparks dance around Rulli as wisps of electricity travel up and down his body.

Avawren curtsies to Rulli.

Tabubu's eyes crinkle upward at the edges, though the rest of her face is concealed by the folds of her black wool cowl.

Rulli amusedly says, "Some have a hard time telling us apart, but I assure you, we are different enough."

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

Speaking to Rulli, Avawren says, "I will do my best to keep you straight then, and remember your name. Thank you for hosting."

Speaking sincerely to Avawren, Rulli says, "Oh no, we are truly honored that you chose to join us this evening."

You nod in agreement.

Ithilwyn smiles.

Squire Legionnaire Galliah just arrived.

Avawren flushes slightly, some color reaching her cheeks.

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Galliah wipes the sweat from her brow.

Rulli smiles at Galliah.

Speaking in Elven, Galliah says, "Pardon my tardiness."

Rulli nods in greeting at Galliah.

Ithilwyn grins at Galliah.

You say, "We're honored that all of you could find the time to attend."

She has a shooting star tattoo on her neck.

You nod to Galliah in greeting.

Speaking to Rulli, Avawren says, "Not at all, the Fortress has been my home for nearly two years now. I woudln't miss the rare party here for the world."

<span style="color:red">Qalinor smiles. </span>

<span style="color:red">Galliah curtsies to Qalinor.</span>

Speaking to Avawren, Rulli says, "Still, anyone who chooses to take time to come to these events, it means quite a bit to us."

Avawren nods graciously at Rulli.

Lord Raxl just arrived.

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

Speaking to Rulli, Raxl asks, "I didn't miss the treats did I?"

Speaking in Elven, Galliah says, "It is always a pleasure to return home."

Raxl blinks.

Galliah smiles quali

Tabubu looks thoughtfully at Raxl.

<span style="color:red">Raxl snaps to attention and crisply strikes his chest with a closed fist in a display of respect to Qalinor.</span>

Speaking quietly to Galliah, Avawren says, "Good to see you again, my dear."

A strolling band of musicians begins a sprightly dance tune.

Galliah grins.

Raxl grins.

Speaking to Raxl, Avawren asks, "And you ... I hear congratulations are in order?"

Raxl blinks.

You nod to Raxl in greeting.

Speaking to Avawren, Raxl says, "Well I haven't married her yet but at least she hasn't run off so...."

The musicians end on a soft and gentle note.

You take a drink from your rose-infused champagne.  Floral, yet dry, and filled with tiny bubbles that tickle the tongue.

You have 4 quaffs left.

Rulli begins chuckling at Raxl!

Speaking to Raxl, Rulli says, "It's a good sign she hasn't run off... yet."

Rulli grins.

Speaking amusedly to Raxl, Avawren says, "I meant your training."

Speaking softly to Rulli, Ithilwyn says, "I would love to."

Ithilwyn smiles at Rulli.

Rulli dances lightly across the dance floor with Ithilwyn.

Galliah gazes thoughtfully at a bright copper cart.

The soft melodies of a silver-stringed harp and an alto recorder fill the evening air as the musicians begin a song echoing the soft breezes of spring.

Speaking to Avawren, Raxl says, "Thank you.  It was a lot of hard work."

Rulli twirls Ithilwyn gracefully across the dance floor.

Ithilwyn giggles.

Ithilwyn grins at Rulli.

Orssus pours himself a glass of smooth bourbon.

There is nothing in the wrap.

Speaking to Ithilwyn, Rulli compliments, "Lovely execution. You're quite graceful."

Speaking to Raxl, Avawren says, "And it has paid off. You could run circles around me now, I'm certain."

Avawren chuckles.

As the tune finishes, the gathered listeners applaud gently.

Raxl scoffs.

Speaking softly to Rulli, Ithilwyn says, "You are as well, you haven't stepped on my foot once."

Ithilwyn grins at Rulli.

Rulli chuckles.

Speaking to Avawren, Raxl says, "Nonsense, any man who was smart would run directly to you rather than in circles around you."

Raxl winks.

Tabubu applauds politely.

Speaking amusedly to Ithilwyn, Rulli says, "Seems all my time in warcamps is paying off. I tend to have to move lightly from side to side dodging their swings."

Speaking in Elven to Raxl, Galliah asks, "Why did you not bring her?"

Gentle melodies flow forth from the musicians' instruments.

Speaking softly to Rulli, Ithilwyn says, "I tried my hand at one last night with some friends.  It was my first attempt."

Speaking to Galliah, Raxl says, "She was indisposed this evening or I would have."

Speaking to Galliah, Raxl says, "A bit under the weather I believe."

Speaking curiously to Ithilwyn, Rulli asks, "Oh? And what did you think?"

Orssus begins chuckling at Galliah!

Speaking softly to Rulli, Ithilwyn says, "It was quite exhilarating."

Ithilwyn beams happily at Rulli!

Speaking to Ithilwyn, Rulli says, "You never know what will happen in them, it makes them quite thrilling."

You hum distractedly as your mind wanders.

The musicians end on a soft and gentle note.

Speaking softly to Rulli, Ithilwyn says, "I think I've seen you around here occasionally.  Let me introduce myself, I am Ithilwyn."

Rulli smiles at Ithilwyn.

Speaking to Orssus, Avawren asks, "Is your wife not joining us this evening? What is a ball in Ta'Vaalor without watching the two of you dance the night away?"

Ithilwyn smiles at Rulli.

You feel at full magical power again.

<span style="color:red">Speaking to you, Qalinor says, "How have the nights been going at keeping the Grimswarm under control?  Such a necessary and appreciated service it is." </span>

<span style="color:red">Qalinor smiles. </span>

Speaking to Ithilwyn, Rulli says, "I know I've seen you before. It's a shame we're now only making introductions.  I'm Rulli."

Rulli smiles at Ithilwyn.

Orssus says, "She wont be able to make it unfortunately, had some family business to see to."

Speaking softly to Rulli, Ithilwyn says, "It is good to meet you, Rulli."

Ithilwyn smiles.

Orssus says, "She asked that I make an appearance though."

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Speaking to Ithilwyn, Rulli replies, "And you, Lady Ithilwyn."

Speaking to Orssus, Raxl says, "Now it's clear, she's probably off with Mikyla somewhere planning something.  We need to be on our toes."

Raxl appears to be trying hard not to grin.

Ithilwyn grins at Rulli.

Speaking to Ithilwyn, Rulli says, "Careful now, this next move will be different."

The music seems to wind on forever, bringing old memories and thoughts long forgotten to the surface of your mind.

Speaking to Orssus, Raxl says, "Who knows, I let her make the decisions now days."

Ithilwyn holds Rulli close in her arms as they dance.

Rulli smiles at Ithilwyn.

Raxl agrees with Avawren.

Speaking to Avawren, Raxl says, "I find it gets me in less trouble for sure."

Speaking quietly to Ithilwyn, Rulli says, "Let's try this now."

Rulli swings Ithilwyn out then spins her right back into his arms.

Avawren nods in agreement.

The musicians strike up an old romantic ballad.

Ithilwyn grins at Rulli.

Rulli smiles at Ithilwyn.

Speaking to Raxl, Avawren says, "One has to pick their battles."

Speaking softly to Rulli, Ithilwyn says, "It seems training does enhance dancing."

Galliah works her hands and fingers through a practiced series of intricate gestures with a confident flourish, arcane phrases flowing freely off her tongue.

Galliah gestures.

The group finishes the music and pauses to let the listeners chat a bit.

Ithilwyn grins at Rulli.

Rulli chuckles.

Raxl agrees with Avawren.

Laevender smiles.

Speaking to Raxl, Galliah says, "So she shall recognize you in the future."

Galliah grins.

Raxl nods.

Laevender says, "Quite alright, young man.  I am Laevender, as I believe has been said."

Laevender smiles at Raxl.

Gentle melodies flow forth from the musicians' instruments.

Speaking to Galliah, Raxl says, "Like I've ever had an issue with ladies touching me."

Speaking to Laevender, Raxl says, "It is a pleasure to meet you."

Speaking to Raxl, Orssus asks, "Have you bottled that scent?"

Orssus chuckles.

Laevender says, "And you."

Speaking to Orssus, Raxl says, "I should.  I could call it, "It's not trapped, I swear!"."

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

Ithilwyn chuckles.

Ithilwyn blushes a nice shade of light pink.

Speaking softly to Jaranzair, Ithilwyn says, "Allow me to introduce you to Laevender, please."

Speaking softly to Laevender, Ithilwyn says, "This is Lord Legionnaire Commander Jaranzair."

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Speaking in Elven to Laevender, Jaranzair says, "If you require to touch, you may touch me."

Speaking in Elven, Laevender says, "Thank you, sir."

Speaking in Elven to Laevender, Jaranzair says, "I cannot allow you to get so close to the King, however. I will have to do."

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Laevender, Qalinor says, "He's the one that smells like no fun." </span>

Orssus becomes solid again.

Laevender touches Jaranzair.

<span style="color:red">Speaking softly to Qalinor, Ithilwyn says, "My Sovereign, I would like the honor of introducing you as well."</span>

You chortle.

You clasp a hand over your mouth.

<span style="color:red">Speaking softly to Laevender, Ithilwyn says, "Laevender, this is our King Qalinor."</span>

Ithilwyn smiles.

Galliah chuckles.

Speaking in Elven, Laevender says, "Thank you."

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Ithilwyn, Qalinor says, "It would be my pleasure, though I'm afraid touch may not be allowed." </span>

Ithilwyn nods.

<span style="color:red">Laevender snaps to attention and crisply brings her rose-infused champagne to her chest in a display of respect to Qalinor.</span>

The music seems to wind on forever, bringing old memories and thoughts long forgotten to the surface of your mind.

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Ithilwyn, Qalinor says, "It is a security thing." </span>

Laevender mutters under her breath.

Laevender's cheeks flush a deep shade of dark rose.

<span style="color:red">Speaking softly to Qalinor, Ithilwyn says, "Completely understandable my Sovereign."</span>

Ithilwyn curtsies.

Ithilwyn smiles.

Speaking in Elven, Laevender says, "My Sovereign it has been many years since I have been in the presence of a King.  It is an honor to meet you."

Orssus says, "I believe that's the first time I've seen someone touch Lord Legionnaire Commander Jaranzair, and not be in the process of a choke slam."

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Ithilwyn blinks at Orssus.

Ithilwyn blushes a nice shade of light pink.

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Laevender, Qalinor says, "Well executed salute for one who sees poorly.  It is an honor to have you with us tonight."</span>

Ithilwyn scrubs her hand through her very long silver blonde hair in frustration.

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Laevender, Qalinor says, "We hope that you enjoy whatever time Koar gives you here in the Fortress."</span>

Galliah takes a drink from her rose-infused champagne.

Laevender says, "Oh, I do not see at all, but I do get a sense of people the closer I am to them.  Touch allows me to distinguish them more easily in the future."

Laevender smiles.

The group finishes the music and pauses to let the listeners chat a bit.

You say, "Quite so, in fact, I think we've only met once and you knew me right away."

Laevender nods to you.

Laevender says, "Nothing wrong with my memory."

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Laevender, Qalinor says, "Well, I'd hate to even guess what I may smell like."</span>

Ithilwyn grins.

Laevender says, "And without my sight, it's important to me to remember."

<span style="color:red">Qalinor chuckles. </span>

The musicians strike up an old romantic ballad.

Laevender says, "I served well past my century, sir.  Retired almost 500 years ago."

Laevender smiles.

Ithilwyn grins at Laevender.

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Laevender, Qalinor says, "And the Crown thanks you for it as we do all those who serve the Fortress."</span>

The musicians end on a soft and gentle note.

Laevender says, "But my daughter felt it was dangerous to live on my own now, so she brought me back into town."

Raxl nods at Galliah.

The light blue glow leaves Orssus.

Speaking to Raxl, Galliah says, "That would be grand of you. Unexpected, and appreciated.  Thank you."

Laevender says, "It's quite refreshing to be back in the Fortress."

Galliah smiles at Raxl.

Galliah coughs.

Laevender says, "Thank you, my Sovereign."

Speaking to Raxl, Galliah whispers aloud, "That was meant to be a whisper."

Galliah coughs.

Galliah ducks her head.

Orssus begins chuckling at Galliah!

Laevender takes a drink from her rose-infused champagne.

Speaking softly to Galliah, Ithilwyn says, "Champagne does that to me as well."

Ithilwyn pats Galliah lightly on the head.

Galliah says, "The music stopped just then."

Galliah coughs.

Galliah blushes a glowing shade of red.

Gentle melodies flow forth from the musicians' instruments.

Raxl says, "If you'll all excuse me. I'm afraid I really should check on Mikyla."

Galliah asks, "Well I could have said worse things, though I likely would not have.  But could you imagine?"

Galliah grins.

Laevender smiles.

Raxl says, "It was a pleasure seeing you all again."

Ithilwyn grins at Galliah.

<span style="color:red">Raxl snaps to attention and crisply brings his lemon finger cookie to his chest in a display of respect to Qalinor.</span>

<span style="color:red">Qalinor nods at Raxl. </span>

Laevender says, "It was good to meet you."

Speaking softly to Raxl, Ithilwyn says, "Safe journeys."

The group finishes the music and pauses to let the listeners chat a bit.

Speaking to Laevender, Raxl says, "The pleasure was mine."

Raxl grins at Galliah.

Raxl gobbles down his lemon finger cookie in one enormous bite.

Lord Raxl just went out.

Speaking to Galliah, Orssus says, "I doubt you would be confessing anything too embarassing to Raxl."

Orssus smiles.

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

<span style="color:red">Speaking in Elven to Qalinor, Jaranzair says, "We should be going, My Sovereign. The hour grows late."</span>

Speaking to Orssus, Galliah says, "That is correct, and I am glad you can recognize it without me having to say so explicitly."

Galliah grins at Orssus.

Laevender muses, "Jaranzair.  Your name is familiar.  I'm guessing there was some overlap."

Speaking to Galliah, Orssus says, "Let the giant be blunt."

Orssus chuckles.

The music seems to wind on forever, bringing old memories and thoughts long forgotten to the surface of your mind.

Laevender says, "Oh, forgive me for speaking hastily and interrupting."

Ithilwyn softly says, "It was an honor to be in your presence again, Lord Commander and my Sovereign."

<span style="color:red">Ithilwyn snaps to attention and crisply strikes her chest with a closed fist in a display of respect to Qalinor.</span>

A strolling band of musicians begins a sprightly dance tune.

Ithilwyn snaps to attention and crisply strikes her chest with a closed fist in a display of respect to Jaranzair.

Rulli humbly says, "I cannot thank you both enough for being able to make it this evening."

<span style="color:red">Qalinor nods at Jaranzair. </span>

You nod in agreement.

You smile.

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Qalinor, Rulli says, "My Sovereign it was such an honor having you."</span>

<span style="color:red">Laevender snaps to attention and crisply strikes her chest with a closed fist in a display of respect to Qalinor.</span>

<span style="color:red">Rulli snaps to attention and crisply brings his smooth bourbon to his chest in a display of respect to Qalinor.</span>

Laevender snaps to attention and crisply strikes her chest with a closed fist in a display of respect to Jaranzair.

<span style="color:red">You snap to attention and crisply strike your chest with a closed fist in a display of respect to Qalinor.</span>

Jaranzair nods once.

<span style="color:red">Qalinor says, "The pleaure, as always was mine." </span>

You feel at full magical power again.

<span style="color:red">Galliah turns toward Qalinor and renders a sharp hand salute.</span>

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

Speaking in Elven to Rulli, Jaranzair says, "Though I wasn't on the invitation, thank you for having me."

Orssus put a glass of smooth bourbon in his waern pelt cape.

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Rulli, Qalinor says, "Thank you again for the invitation."</span>

Rulli grins.

<span style="color:red">Orssus faces Qalinor and smartly brings his right fist up to his chest.  Holding it there, he bows deeply.</span>

Speaking to Jaranzair, Rulli says, "It won't be overlooked next time."

Rulli chuckles.

Jaranzair winks at Rulli.

Laevender touches Jaranzair.

Laevender says, "Thank you, sir."

<span style="color:red">Galliah snaps to attention and crisply strikes her chest with a closed fist in a display of respect to Qalinor.</span>

You politely say, "Please, excuse me. I hope you all have a lovely evening."

Galliah snaps to attention and crisply strikes her chest with a closed fist in a display of respect to Jaranzair.

Laevender smiles.

The soft melodies of a silver-stringed harp and an alto recorder fill the evening air as the musicians begin a song echoing the soft breezes of spring.

Laevender says, "We used to go to balls all the time when I was younger."

<span style="color:red">King Qalinor's group just went out. </span>

Ithilwyn smiles at Laevender.

Laevender smiles wistfully

Orssus says, "He winked."

Orssus chuckles.

Rulli says, "Thank you all for coming."

Orssus removes a glass of smooth bourbon from in his waern pelt cape.

Orssus takes a drink from his smooth bourbon.

Ithilwyn softly says, "Perhaps he is more playful than I assumed."
