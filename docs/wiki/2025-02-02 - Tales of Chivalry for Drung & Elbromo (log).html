[Gryphon Holding, Great Hall]
A light draft stirs the banners draped overhead, each measure of silk representing a knight of the Order.  Dominating the room is a massive oak table with a dozen tall chairs around it.  Three smaller tables are set up in an alcove off the eastern wall for more private gatherings.  Elaborate figurines of former members line the mantel of a huge fireplace set at the far end of the room.  Flanking the hearth, floor-to-ceiling shelves hold a wide selection of reading material and ancient tomes.  You also see the mural-sided Perigourd cassone, a rough oak table with some stuff on it, a live-edge thanot table set on spiraled rakka horn legs with some stuff on it, a white monir table burned with a keep-overlooked seaside cityscape with some stuff on it, a newel staircase and a wooden ladder.
 
 
You say, "Please let me know if you are planning on sharing a tale of chivalry tonight."
 
 
You cordially greet, "Welcome to the Holding, everyone. It is good to see you all."
 
You say, "There are refreshments on the tables."
  
You cordially greet, "Evening everyone. If you are just arriving, refreshments are on the tables. If you wish to share a tale tonight, please let me know."

You say, "Welcome to the Holding."
 
Speaking to Jarnsaixa, you say, "You have forunate timing, we were just about to begin."
 
 
You cordially greet, "Welcome, everyone, to the Holding for our fourth annual Tales of Chivalry. The Order is pleased to host everyone tonight as we celebrate the memory of our friends, Lords Drung and Elbromo."

You somberly state, "We began this tradition of chivalric tales to inspire others. As Drung and Elbromo inspired everyone

You lay your palm across the arching symbol of two knotwork grizzly bears on your vultite brooch, your fingers curling around the vultite edges, and bow your head in a moment of respect for all those that have come before you, for all those who have fallen at your side, and for those that are yet to come.


You say, "Tonight we also begin our year-long celebration of the Order s founding. Over the years, we have lost many other friends and comrades, so let us also honor their collective memory with our tales this evening."

You say, "I will not get into the details of our founding, as you will hear more on that soon, but it is a great honor to be part of the Order during its thirtieth year. While we are young, compared to some Orders within the Empire, thirty years is no small feat. I am greatly looking forward to all of the celebrations we have planned for this year."

 
You clearly continue, "Tonight we will hear several tales of chivalry. Each of these tales will be judged by our panel of former Leaders of the Order."

 
You say, "Our judges, tonight will be. Sir Cryheart, Sir Geijon, and Dame Deavon."

   
You say, "The judges will be evaluating the tales for their Creativity, Presentation, and overall chivalric content."

You continue, "The purpose of this event is to share inspirational stories that exemplify the Code, whether it is Kai s Talismans or the writings of Sir Pyrrhon. We hope that they will serve as inspiration for everyone here long after we conclude our discussion tonight."


You say, "We will give a final call for anyone interested in sharing a tale or song this evening."



You say, "Very well. Before we begin, we have two Tales from the Order itself that our members will share. First, Herald Regwen will share the tale of the founding of the Order."

You nod encouragingly at Regwen.


You say, "Herald. You have the floor."

 
Regwen theatrically says, "I have an Epic poem to share this evening.  This Epic is based on true events chronicled in "The Abandoned Holding" by Sir Brinn and "Tale of two Barons" by Sir Cryheart."


Regwen recites evenly:
    "Baron Hochstib in far off Jantalar, where he ruled,
     Turned his eyes to war, greed and expansion fueled.
     Hochstib hated non-humans though being half-elf, we knew.
     So Chaston's edict helped him to enslave ordlyn cruel."


(Regwen takes a couple steps to the left.)


Regwen recites darkly:
    "Jealous of the silver trade profits Vornavis had made,
     Talador was the first neighbor Baron Hochstib did raid.
     The Baron didn't believe their silver mine had been played.
     When found true, "A non-human plot against him!", he raged!"


 
Regwen recites darkly:
    "Mean time, Mestanir was the next the Baron had attacked.
     This war was fought for the land that the Jantalars lacked.
     After great losses were dealt by sorcerers Mestanir backed,
     Witch hunters and Mantis crystal were used, mana to extract."


Regwen recites heavily:
    "In Talador, Fights tween Dwarves and Humans caused Chaston's Edict used.
     Ordlyn miners were enslaved and mistreated and a riot soon ensued.
     Sir Maldon's son was sent to the mine, violence to be subdued.
     But the Baron ordered the mine sealed, everyone there was entombed."


Kothos takes a drink from his mulled red wine.
Regwen hangs her head.
 
Regwen slings a silver-inlaid varnished ash mandolin strung with twisted silver off from over her shoulder.
Regwen sings powerfully:
    "Deep in the mines, down in the dark.
     Up rose a cry from deep in the heart.
     "Freedom!" they cried. "Freedom!" they called.
     Freedom arose from the dwarven halls."
 
 
Regwen sings powerfully:
    ""They must be stopped!", the Crab did cry.
     "They must be stopped or I'll know why!"
     Down the dark maw his troops did slide.
     Into that horde of dwarven tide."


 .
Regwen sings powerfully:
    "They fought and yelled to no avail!
     Nothing would stop that rising wail.
     And so at impasse they did arrive.
     But impasse does not the Baron drive."

As Regwen plays her varnished ash mandolin, some silver stars suddenly flow out of the instrument, pulled into existence from the magic of her song.

Regwen sings powerfully:
    ""Seal the caves I do command!"
     "Seal the mines to the last man!"
     So the Crab called out, so it was done.
     From the dark maw the sounds there were none."


Regwen sings powerfully:
    "Sealed in the dark both dwarf and man.
     Sealed in the dark by the Crab's left hand.
     Sealed in the dark was one man's soul.
     Sealed in the dark was the Crab's true role."


Regwen slings a silver-inlaid varnished ash mandolin strung with twisted silver over her shoulder.
 
(Regwen takes a step forward and glances around ready to continue her presentation.)
 
Regwen recites evenly:
    "Hochstib's knight, Sir Maldon, was sent, an abandoned keep to hold.
     This being a lame basis for a claim to the landing so we're told.
     Five companions went along to explore the abandoned hold.
     Lords Berr, Pip, Geoff,  Heinrich and Brinn all warriors brave and bold."

Regwen recites hushedly:
    "The stone tower loomed above the overgrown surrounding marsh,
     Flanked by eight apple trees in two rows of four, like grim guards.
     Under gabled roof and battlement peered arrow slit windows sparse.
     It presented a sinister appearance with its disrepair so harsh."

(Regwen takes a couple of tentative step backward.)

 
Regwen recites mysteriously:
    "Our heroes were met only by rodents amid the layer of dust and mold.
     But as they entered the masters room a dark mystery was about to unfold.
     A headless skeleton lay sprawled on the floor, feet away the head had rolled.
     Collapsed against the wall, the bed held a corpse, boots still on, long cold."


Regwen leans back.
(Regwen gazes around room and pauses.)
  
Regwen recites dramatically:
    "In the chest next to the bed, they found the effects of the former master.
     Within, a heaume, a pair of golden spurs and a small sack of leather.
     A silk surcoat embroidered with a crimson hawk, the charge of Sir Trevar.
     Under the chests corner was found a sheet of parchment, most of a letter."

 
Regwen removes a piece of parchment from in her silk cloak.
Regwen gazes with interest at the piece of parchment in her hand.
 
Regwen simply states, "Which read:"
Regwen cryptically reads, "And as I have conveyed my reasons for notifying the dwarven clans of my discovery to my lord, the baron, I will await his reply. I doubt he will be pleased. I feel my finding it upon the day of the Equinox was fated, and."


(Regwen glaces up abruptly.)
Regwen says, "The message was cut short."
 
Regwen put a piece of parchment in her silk cloak.
Regwen takes a deep breath.
 
  
Regwen recites speculatively:
    "The skeleton wore a pouch and grasped the rusted dagger in its possession.
     The point and edges of the dagger were less rusted, on final examination.
      It appeared that they were coated with something that inhibited some corrosion.
     Was Sir Trevar poisoned while beheading his assailant? Was the Speculation."



Regwen frowns.
 
Regwen recites hushedly:
    "Discovered inside the skeleton's pouch, a small parchment, wire creation.
     Finely woven red gold wires pressed into parchment, a triangular triskelion.
     Known in court as a "three cornered pardon", for an act of soon initiation.
     Given to those who may run afoul of the law while entrusted with a "mission"."


Regwen ponders.
 
Regwen recites direly:
    "Had the Baron sent an assassin to kill Sir Trevar allowing for replacement?
     Baron Hochstib turned his sight to Vornavis hoping to increase his settlement.
     He blockaded Baron Malwind's supplies and hoped to stall Landing aid to Vornavis.
     After Vornavis he would move to stake claim to the landing environment."

 
(Regwen moves forward a step and stand firmly.)
 
Regwen recites defiantly:
    "Sir Maldon had served loyally, but his son's death was the Baron's responsibility.
     So Sir Maldon would foil the Baron's ambitions, if there was any possibility.
     The baron's Landing claim was based in part on the lack of any local nobility.
     Thus was born the chivalric knightly order
         The Silver Gryphons, Officially."


Regwen raises her fist defiantly.
Regwen strikes a heroic pose.


Regwen recites evenly:
    "Because the Empress aided the baron with mandis crystals to drain mana entirely.
     The Gryphon order would consist of warriors to protect the Landing non-magically.
     The baron couldn't move troops here before the spring, and no imperial troops, practically.
     By then the Order would help to train the locals and curb the general chaos with chivalry."

Geijon says, "Officially recognized on th' Scrolls of Immuron, perhaps even twice."
Regwen states, "This song was popular at the time, so I'm told:"
Regwen slings a silver-inlaid varnished ash mandolin strung with twisted silver off from over her shoulder.
   
Regwen sings powerfully:
    "The Soul arrived on Landing's water,
     Shorn of son, no longer father.
     A dozen warriors strong and brave,
     Stepped up and heard the story grave."


Regwen sings powerfully:
    "The Holding searched and death was found.
     Death abed and beheaded to ground.
     Assassin's badge and parchment torn.
     Knife in hand and armor worn."


Regwen sings powerfully:
    "Forge discovered, dwarves revealed.
     Message to Baron safely repealed.
     A dozen warriors stood side by side.
     And swore to avenge that dwarven tide."

As Regwen plays her varnished ash mandolin, some silver stars suddenly flow out of the instrument, pulled into existence from the magic of her song.

Regwen sings powerfully:
    "Landing Safe and People true.
     The warriors pledged their strength to You.
     A dozen warriors a fortress small.
     Warriors against the Landing's fall."


Regwen slings a silver-inlaid varnished ash mandolin strung with twisted silver over her shoulder.


(Regwen gazes around the room and smiles widely.)
Regwen exclaims, "Hail the Silver Gryphons!"

 
Speaking to Regwen, you say, "Thank you, Herald."

 
Jarnsaixa says, "Well done, herald.  I look forward to sharing with the chamberlain your talents."

 
Evia says, "I adore that telling."
 
You say, "Now, Batchwyn Missoni has another Tale of the Order to share."

You say, "Bathcwyn, the floor is yours."
 
Missoni strides in front of a chair of undyed silk propped on flora-motif carved illthorn legs and sits, perching primly on the front half of the seat.  She crosses her ankles and tucks her feet beneath the chair.

Missoni begins, "This is a song of the rescue of Korm from Jantalar. It was written shortly after the event by Eirinn the Bard, daughter of Aonghus and Elana, and was collected for our library by Lord Errick Dyfedd."


Missoni rubs her vortex stone prism.  A pale mist swirls sinuously down her arm and coalesces into the form of a pale ethereal mandolin twinkling with prismatic motes along argentine strings in her left hand.


(Missoni smooths her skirts before resting the mandolin on her lap, her fingers readied against the metal of the strings that gleams in the warm firelight.)


Missoni recites:
    "Come, gather, hear my tale
     Of valor and nobility
     Of Gryphons gathered in their flight
     To keep our Landing free."


(Missoni begins a soft but measured strumming on her mandolin, the tempo a brisk march in a major key.)
 
Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    "In past there was a foul man, a Baron born and bred
     To battle fierce he'd often go, his coming we would dread.
     Gryphons mighty, gathered 'round, Fierce warriors and brave
     To join a dwarven man stepped forth, his help he freely gave."

Missoni recites:
    "Grief! Agony! Pain and loss!
     Brave Korm was gone to us
     Jantalar, you'll pay the price
     Your death is worth the fuss."
 
Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    "Through sewers rank and smelly walked past the horrid bugs
     Though so quietly not to be heard our motions soon were caught
     We stumbled on a half-ogre, half-centaur: mighty guard
     Gurbah, how we treated you, makes my heart-strings taut."

Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    "Battle-lust had reign of us, first thought was to attack
     But shocked and awed, our mouths gaped wide, no defense did he lack.
     Rightly so you angered were, the Gryphons tried to mend
     Though one could not believe that you could become a friend."

Sparks shoot up from the flames to dance in the hot air above the fire.  They glow brightly for a time and then slowly burn up and fly away as ash on the wind.  You feel this is a commentary on life itself, and it saddens you for a moment.

Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    "First duel came and went with ease, you turned his blade aside.
     Yet rather than your vengeance seek, you watched our heroes bide
     No magic in those sordid halls beneath the horrid land
     And firmly 'gainst our Gryphons you still had might to stand."

Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    "Surpised were we at your advice of a hidden room
     Saved the Lord who with you fought from his very doom
     Magic worked our hero lived, and still you gave them pause
     So, thus when the next Lord spoke, his challenge had a cause."

(Missoni transitions from the series of chords to brisk arpeggios, the notes ringing more quickly as the song builds in intensity.)

Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    "This time the battle longer went, and yet you still stood fast
     Our heroes wondered what to do, they needed to get past
     The healer sweet had seen you wince, and cured you from your pain
     And grateful you decided to join the Gryphon's train."

Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    ""You Lords," you said, "Are brave to stand up to my skill
     And I have more respect for you than my master's will.
     I will travel on with you, to see what next will be."
     And that is how the Gryphons Silver passed to the next key."

Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    "Once again we walked our course down a darkened stair
     We came upon an iron door that led to Gods know where
     The first who had raised sword before, humble, knelt to pick
     We were glad to hear the sound of one submissive "click."

(Missoni sets her hands on the strings, stifling the notes to allow her voice to ring clearly across the hall. Her fingers snap with a *click*.)


Missoni recites:
    "Evil! Horrors! What we beheld!
     The dungeon, cells abound
     A bloated arm from one of them
     Yet no corpse to be found!"

(Missoni touches the mandolin's strings again. A series of hushed notes stream forth to match a hushed tone in her voice.)

Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    "Dread pursued within our hearts as we approached a door
     Black as ever horrors were, from ceiling to the floor
     A scream rang crisply through the room, an elven woman: Dead
     No help in sight but pray for her, avenge her death instead."

Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    "Our breaths were held when the Lord knelt the black door for to try
     And in the distance, the dreadful note of a child's cry
     We hastened quickly through the door afraid of what lay there
     And what we saw I guarantee turned white our every hair."
Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    "We rushed on through, tried not to look, our next door stood in wait
     And opened came the lock, submitting to its fate"


(Missoni slows her fingers, the notes of the mandolin fading slowly this time, rather than abruptly stopping. She waits for silence, her eyes scanning those gathered before beginning anew, this time sans accompaniment.)


Missoni takes a deep breath.
Missoni softly says, "Our hearts stopped cold... To what we saw a-lying on the floor."

Missoni grimly says, "Korm's corpse lay there, abused and dead, amongst the blood and gore."

Missoni sings softly:
    "Fortune was that we could still return him from Her grasp
     Sweet Lorminstra decided to release him to our clasp.
     All he wore: a stained loincloth, and blood ran from his pores
     And calming Gurbah seemed the next of our long chores."
Jarnsaixa frowns.

Missoni sings softly:
    "Retribution in the lands of Jantalar is fierce
     The torture room proves death not proud, and brings us to more tears
     But yet, Gurbah, ye set us free, our friend away to tow
     And back into the small store room, our party was to go."



Missoni sings softly:
    "Korm, bespelled and weak, bereft of his arm, alive
     The Silver Gryphons, cleric mage, and our wily guide
     We ran for our lives back through the dank and dismal sewer maze
      Until Talenni, Queen of Thieves, had caught us in her gaze."



Missoni sings softly:
    "Now that the end was in sight, we finally could smile
     Korm took a look at the footpad, and turned toward his exile
     We stopped him, and explained to him that she had helped us out
     And so the rescue was complete, we'd freed him from the lout."

J
Missoni sings with a soaring soprano:
    "So, come ye gentles one and all, and praise to the great people
     Who valiantly fought and won the freedom of their friend
     The Silver Gryphons, Warriors brave who fight to keep us free
     For them this ballad has been sung, Their Glory I decree!"


(Missoni strums a single chord, allowing its cheerful tone to fade to silence before bowing her head.)


Cryheart says, "Well done, Bathcwyn Missoni."

Speaking to Missoni, you say, "A truly, truly wonderful rendition."
 
Speaking to Jarnsaixa, Missoni says, "Of course."

Jarnsaixa says, "The footpad."
 
 
Kothos turns to face Jarnsaixa.
Jarnsaixa asks, "What was the name again?"
 
Speaking to Jarnsaixa, Missoni says, "The Queen of Thieves? Talenni."
 
Jarnsaixa looks lost in thought.

 
Jarnsaixa nods slowly.
 
You clear your throat.
Speaking to Jarnsaixa, Missoni says, "You are familar with her daughter, i think."

Jarnsaixa says, "Ah, then it is the same one."
Jarnsaixa nods at Missoni.
 
You say, "Thank you again, Missoni."

You exclaim, "Now that we have learned a bit about our history, our first competitor for the evening!"
A 
Jarnsaixa nods at Geijon.
 
You exclaim, "Delindra, the floor is yours!"
 
Delindra says, "Good evening, friends."
Delindra smiles.
 
Kothos grins at Delindra.
  
An eclipse of spectral moths flutters out from inside Delindra's cloak, dropping a gold-inlaid maple lute into her hand.
 
Mourdeyan applauds Delindra.
 
(Delindra sets her fingers to her lute strings, playing a soft, slow tune, her normally jovial expression changing to one of intense focus.)

Delindra gently says, "I collected this song from a man who wrote about a voyage, a tale he had heard many times before putting it to music. Which voyage is unimportant, though; enough that it was long, and hard, and the crew faced many dangers along the way. After great struggles and conflicts, they were successful in their quest, which was to keep their families safe."


Delindra gently says, "But... as they set out once more, they realized they were in uncharted waters, with no idea of how to find their way home again. This is their song of hope, of perseverance in adversity, that they might survive the journey, and see their loves once more."

 
Delindra sings flowingly:
    "Heel ye ho, boys, let her go, boys
     Bring her head  round, into the weather
     Heel ye ho, boys, let her go, boys
     Sailing homeward
     To  Haven Bay"


Delindra sings confidently:
    "What care we, boys, how white the waves are?
     What care we, boys, of wind or weather?
     When we know that every inch is
     Sailing homeward
     To  Haven Bay"


(Delindra appears to be absorbed in her hand moving across the fretboard, her face stoic as she continues to play.)
 
Delindra sings clearly:
    "Clap your eyes on the sun arising
     Gulls and doves fill the sky with feathers
     Cut her loose, boys, for the h'rizon
     We ll be home soon
     In  Haven Bay"



Delindra sings melodically:
    "Heel ye ho, boys, let her go, boys
     Bring her head  round, into the weather
     Heel ye ho, boys, let her go, boys
     Sailing homeward
     To  Haven Bay"


Delindra sings wistfully:
    "Our loves await us, on the bank, or
     Looking seaward from the heather
     Pull her round, boys, then you ll anchor
      Ere the sun sets
     On  Haven Bay"


Delindra sings tenderly:
    "Our loves are waiting, anticipating
     For the end of our adventures.
     Don t you cry, loves, we re returning
     To the home shores
     Of  Haven Bay"

 
(Delindra pauses a moment before launching into the final chorus, taking a deep breath. The words come soft and slow at first, her voice and lute playing slowly growing in intensity before the final words ring out.)


Delindra sings slowly:
    "Heel ye ho, boys, let her go, boys
     Bring her head  round, into the weather
     Heel ye ho, boys, let her go, boys
     Sailing homeward
     To  Haven Bay"

(Delindra bows her head, hands going still across her lute. She closes her eyes as the final notes ring out, then slowly silence.)


Delindra curtsies.
  
Speaking to Delindra, Missoni murmurs, "Beautiful."

Delindra murmurs, "Thank you."


(Kothos leans forward, running his fingers lightly over his eyelids, wiping away a little moisture.)


You say, "Very well, the judges have shared their scores with me. We will of course announce the results at the end of our tales."



You exclaim, "Now, let us welcome Morandas!"


You say, "Morandas, you have the floor."

Morandas reaches up and brushes a speck of dust from one of the lenses of his spectacles.
Morandas cackles!

Morandas cackles!
Morandas bows to you.
 
Inclining your head slightly, you offer the most minimal of bows to Morandas with an air of utmost politeness.
Morandas puts a black silk tophat on his head.
 
 
Morandas says, "Before I sing, I'd like to say a few words."


Morandas says, "So many are gone, and won't return.  I am grateful to be here.  Lorminstra guide you all."

 
Morandas says, "Please join my wife Temperess so she can whisper something to you so you can hear my song ... in a special way."

Morandas cackles!
Morandas sings earnestly:
    "It started as a simple stroll through Town Square Central's streets,
     With Lorminstra's will to guide me, and my mission to complete.
     But fate had planned a jest for me, as I marched with holy might,
     I stubbed my toe on an amulet......"
Morandas cackles!
Morandas sings shriekingly:
    "And yelped in startled fright!"
Morandas marches up to Geijon and gives him a crisp salute.
Morandas cackles!
Morandas sings gleefully:
    "Oh, I tried, I truly tried, to keep my balance there,
     But the goddess must've chuckled as I tumbled through town square.
     I cackled when I hit the ground, my dignity undone,
     For a cleric's life's not graceful, but......."
Morandas cackles!
Morandas winks at Regwen.
Morandas sings playfully:
    "Oh, it's fun!"
Morandas pokes Evia in the ribs. 
 
Morandas cackles!
Morandas sings grumpily:
    "My head met a wooden shield with a resonating thud,
     I saw stars and cackled loudly as I rose up from the mud.
     "Lorminstra, grant me mercy!" I cried to the open skies,
     Yet a snort escaped my lips"
 
Morandas cackles!
 
Morandas sings sadly:
    "And tears filled my eyes."

Morandas sings melodically:
    "Oh, I tried, I truly tried, to keep my balance there,
     But the goddess must've chuckled as I tumbled through town square.
     I cackled when I hit the ground, my dignity undone,
     For a cleric's life's not graceful, but......."
Morandas cackles!
Morandas sings playfully:
    "Oh, it's fun!"
 
Morandas pokes Deavon in the ribs.
 
Morandas cackles!
Morandas sings somberly:
    "Just as I stood steady, a broadsword blocked my path,
     Ochre and sharp, it sent me flying,oh, the aftermath!
     I flailed like a whirlwind, my robes a tangled mess,
     But through it all, I laughed aloud,what a blessed mess!"
Morandas cackles at Evia!
  
Evia cackles at Morandas!
 
Morandas winks at Meglorna.
 
Morandas begins to flirt with Temperess.
 
 
Morandas sings merrily:
    "The townsfolk gawked and giggled as I crawled on hands and knees,
     Muttering, "Lorminstra, guide me, through trials such as these!"
     Though battered, bruised, and weary, my faith remained intact,
     And every cackle echoed forth as proof of that one fact."
 
 
Morandas cackles!
Morandas sings boisterously:
    "Oh, I tried, I truly tried, to keep my balance there,
     But the goddess must've chuckled as I tumbled through town square.
     I cackled when I hit the ground, my dignity undone,
     For a cleric's life's not graceful, but......"
Morandas cackles!
 
Morandas sings playfully:
    "Oh, it's fun!"
  
Morandas cackles!
Morandas sings earnestly:
    "So here's my grand confession, of my bumbling, holy plight,
     I may not walk with elegance, but I cackle through the night.
     For even in my clumsiness, Lorminstra lights my way,
     I'm Morandas the Cackling Cleric, and I cackle all bloody day!"
Morandas cackles at Ardwen!
Morandas cackles!

Morandas sings thunderously:
    "So here's my grand confession, of my bumbling, holy plight,
     I may not walk with elegance, but I cackle through the night.
     For even in my clumsiness, Lorminstra lights my way,
     I'm Morandas the Cackling Cleric, and I cackle all bloody day!"

Morandas cackles!
 
Morandas sings thunderously:
    "I'm Morandas the Cackling Cleric, and I cackle all bloody day!"

 
Morandas says, "Tis good to be back."
  
Morandas bows to you.

Inclining your head slightly, you offer the most minimal of bows to Morandas with an air of utmost politeness.
 
You say, "Thank you, once again, Morandas. Up next, we have Alosaka."
 
Alosaka smiles.
 
Alosaka exclaims, "Well, if you all know me, you know my tales usually aren't as happy as the ones we just heard... but I promise not to torment you with my singing, so it should all work out!"
      
Alosaka grins.

Alosaka says, "I have a tale tonight about an unusual virtue. Not courage, or strength, or wisdom. Not temperance, or justice. Not mercy or faith."

Alosaka says, "Sometimes, when the world presents its darkest face, and all around is confusion and chaos, filled with people acting in the worst possible way, because they are misled into believing it is only pathway to good... I think Discernment might be the greatest virtue of them all."

Alosaka says, "Discernment. The ability to tell what is true from false. Right from wrong."

Alosaka says, "And so, friends, let me present the tale of Squire Tupelo of Mestanir."

Alosaka bows.

Alosaka says, "Once, in the duchy of Mestanir, there was born a hale young lad. Even as a child his parents and neighbors could see the extraordinary strength in his arms."

Alosaka turns around.
Alosaka strikes a heroic pose.

Alosaka says, "As soon as he was able to handle a shovel, he was out pretending it was a sword, playing Knights and Bandits with his friends."


Alosaka ponders.
Alosaka ponders, "I suppose some things never get old."
Alosaka shrugs.

Alosaka grins.
Alosaka says, "Tupelo continued to grow, and it wasn't long before he came to the attention of the local Baron's men, who were always scouting for talent."

Alosaka squints.
Alosaka nods.
 
Alosaka says, "He had all the makings of a squire, at least. Maybe, they whispered, even a knight."
 
Alosaka exclaims, "And so, barely old enough to grow the first wisps of a beard, he began his training!"


(Alosaka strokes his clean-shaven face, then abruptly strikes a fighting pose, punching at the air with quick huffs of breath!)
  
Alosaka says, "He trained hard. For years he worked, always hearing the knights and other squires say how talented he was. How gifted."


Alosaka slowly says, "How... special."

Alosaka ponders.
Alosaka tilts his head down.


Alosaka says, "And yet, every year, when the tournament came along, now-Squire Tupelo always found himself just outside the champion's circle."


Alosaka frowns.

(Alosaka rubs his shoulder, as if nursing a sore muscle.)
A pained expression crosses Alosaka's face.

Alosaka says, "Every year it was like that. And every year, his mentor assured him that the victory wasn't important. What mattered was that he continued to grow. To build his strength and endurance and learn the ways of knighthood."

Alosaka says, "Victory... was just a piece of ribbon to hang from his spear, after all. No need to get all upset over it."
Alosaka nods.

Alosaka says, "And all this was true, of course. Of course."

Alosaka quietly repeats, "Of course..."
Alosaka shakes his head.

Alosaka says, "But, of course, it wasn't. Victory mattered. Everyone knew that. His mentor's words were just a soothing balm."

Alosaka says, "And so Squire Tupelo spent every day training. Working his muscles until they burned. Until his bones ached."

Alosaka says, "And it was in the fields of Mestanir one day that Squire Tupelo heard the voice."


Alosaka slurs, "Brave sssssquire...."
Alosaka blinks.
Kothos glances at Alosaka.
Alosaka turns around.

Alosaka stoutly exclaims, "Who's there!  Show yourself!" Tupelo shouted!"

Alosaka turns around.
Alosaka frowns.

Morandas cowers away from Alosaka.
Alosaka says, "Again the voice came."
Alosaka slurs, "Down... here..."

(Alosaka tilts his head down, then suddenly leaps back in surprise.)


Alosaka says, "There, in front of him," Alosaka points at the floor, "Hiding in the grass was a viper, just feet away."
 
Alosaka blinks.

 
Alosaka asks, "Said Tupelo, "Did... did you speak?"
 
Alosaka slurs, "Indeed I did," the viper said. "I have been watching you for months. You are so strong, and diligent, and brave."

Alosaka leans forward.
Alosaka's autumn adder flicks its forked tongue once, then raises its head from its post on Alosaka's neck.  With a lazy blink, it slithers down into his grasp, its movements languid.

(Alosaka considers the snake in his hand, half-warily, half in wonder.)
Alosaka's autumn adder writhes slightly as he touches its skin.  As it moves, its sinuous grace is plain to see.  The carefully controlled roll of its muscular body causes the ambient light to momentarily glint off of it.  It shifts for just a moment, then goes still once more.
 
You see Alosaka the Consoler.
He appears to be a Human of the Tehir tribes.
He is average height.  He appears to be very young.  He has fiery deep black eyes and nut brown skin.  He has short, tousled brown hair worn in an array of tight zigzag braids decorated with midnight blue feathers.  He has a delicate face and a small nose.
He has some lines of dark-inked scripture on his wrist, an inked leafing acantha vine crawling across a trellis of slender bones on his arm, and an eclipsed sun and moon tattoo on his arm.
He is in good shape.
He is holding a ruby-dappled sable autumn adder in his right hand.
He is wearing a steely grey frieze coat buttoned with bismuth crystals, an ivory white braided cotton strap with a lacquered rosewood biwa embossed with bronze willow trees strapped to it slung over his shoulder, a faded ivory medicine satchel reinforced with corroded copper rivets, an ivory silk shirt with topaz-pinned cuffs, a simple blued steel wristchain, a black enameled bracer with a silver gryphon set in a ruby circle, a slim bracelet of suede-woven acantha leaves, a twisted gold ring, a charcoal leather map case patterned with brushed gold leaf designs, some belted ashen grey wool trousers, and some shadowy cobalt morduska hide boots buckled with scrollworked silver.

Speaking to his autumn adder, Alosaka asks, "You've been watching... you've seen me?"

Alosaka says, "And the snake replied, "Oh, yesss, I have. And it is ssssuch a tragedy that you have been overlooked. Your victoriessss denied. You deserve them. You deserve them so much."

Alosaka leans back.
Alosaka ponders.
Alosaka says, "Said Tupelo, "I... I do deserve them, don't I? Last time, I should have won that last joust, but sun got in my eyes, and damned Trigenor swept me off my steed."


Alosaka exclaims, "Tupelo continued, "And... The year before, I should have scored that final hit against Squire Polonus, but the judge didn't see it!"

Alosaka slowly empties his lungs.
  
Alosaka says, "And the snake replied, "You sssshould have won, indeed. They cheated you."

Alosaka gazes thoughtfully at his autumn adder.
Alosaka slowly says, "Said Tupelo, "That... maybe..."
Alosaka frowns.
Alosaka says, "And the snake, sensing his confusion, continued, "It is wrong. But I can help you. I can make sure you win next time."
Alosaka bites his lip.

Alosaka asks, "Said Tupelo, "Wouldn't that be cheating myself?"

Alosaka asks, "And the snake said, "Is it truly cheating, if it corrects an injustice? Isn't it just... leveling the field?"

Alosaka glances away.

Alosaka says, "Now, Tupelo had been taught moral clarity by his mentor. He knew right from wrong. But he also knew that, in this world, champions were exalted. And he so desperately wanted to be recognized for what he knew was true: that he was the best."

Alosaka glances at a ruby-dappled sable autumn adder in his hand.
Alosaka says, "And so, Tupelo accepted the snake's bargain."

Alosaka slurs, ""When next you duel in the championship, hide me in your armor, and I will ride on your weapon. And when you cross spears, I will kiss your opponent, and you will be victorious."

Alosaka nods slowly.
Alosaka lifts his autumn adder toward his collarbone, where it slithers around his neck, forming itself into a perfectly symmetrical curve.  Once it's in position, the autumn adder becomes perfectly still.

Alosaka says, "When the day of the Championship came, Tupelo was ready. His body was hardened with months of training. His nerves were afire. And hidden in his armor, coiled around his right arm, was the snake."

Kothos looks thoughtfully at Alosaka.

Alosaka removes a sumac-hafted iron spear with a painted saw-scaled viper wrapped around it from in his ivory satchel.
 
Alosaka gently taps his iron spear, and the painted saw-scaled viper coiled around it hisses as it hurriedly slithers down the length of it in a tight spiral.  Just as quickly, it turns and slinks back to its original position.

Alosaka shivers.
  
Alosaka says, "With every match, whenever his spear crossed his opponent's, the viper snuck out to grace them with a kiss. Their limbs grew heavy. Their breath rattled in their lungs, and it was child's play to knock them down."

Alosaka says, "Match after match, he defeated his fellow squires. None could stand against him."
 
Alosaka touches his spear, and the painted saw-scaled viper coiled around it recoils defensively and rattles its tail.
 
Alosaka says, "And when the day was done, Tupelo stood alone in the champion's circle. All the rest, all his opponents, were taken sick and exhausted to recover."


Alosaka says, "'A miracle!" The assembled crowd cheered. But their eyes betrayed them. They whispered to each other. His mentor frowned and glowered."

Alosaka slowly empties his lungs.
 
Alosaka shrugs.
Alosaka says, "But Tupelo cared not. He had what he wanted. The champion's ribbon. He strung it from his spear with pride and waved it overhead."


(Alosaka grips the spear and raises it high, but his arm trembles, and the spear's tip dances in the air.)
 
Alosaka gulps.
Alosaka says, "Tupelo bent down to whisper his thanks to the snake, but it was gone. It had escaped, slipped away, slithering between distracted feet. Unseen, but not gone. No... never gone."

Alosaka turns around.
Alosaka turns around.
(Alosaka swallows nervously.)
 
Alosaka says, "And though he rarely saw it -- only at night, while lying abed, as a shadow slithering across the floor -- the viper lived in the Tupelo's house forever after."

Alosaka put a sumac-hafted iron spear with a painted saw-scaled viper wrapped around it in his ivory satchel.
Alosaka bows.

Alosaka says, "Discernment. The ability to tell truth from falsehood. Right from wrong."
Alosaka sits down.
 
Goldstr exclaims, "A great tale!"

You say, "Please allow a moment for the judges to discuss the tale."

You muse, "Also making good use of that spear, finally."

Alosaka blushes a florid shade of dark red.
Alosaka ducks his head.

You grin at Alosaka.
 
Alosaka's autumn adder flicks its forked tongue once, then raises its head from its post on Alosaka's neck.  With a lazy  
Alosaka puckers up and blows a kiss at a ruby-dappled sable autumn adder in his hand.
 
You say, "Thank you again, Alosaka for the fine tale."
 
You exclaim, "Sir Balantine, you have the floor!"

Balantine recites quietly:
    "Many consider the Code of Chivalry the domain of formal organizations or Orders of Knights, warriors, monks or priests"
 

Balantine recites quietly:
    "But this brief poem is for each of ye individually, with Chivalry in your heart, and Honor on your mind, as my father Hammer taught me"


Balantine recites quietly:
    "Will You?"


Balantine recites quietly:
    "When danger comes, will you stand or run?
      Will you endure the beating sun?
      Climb the rugged mountain steep?
      Suffer silently or will you weep?"
 
Balantine recites quietly:
    "Will you face your demons down?
      Endure the challenge of renown?
      Or will from your threat now flee?
      And the evil refuse to see?"
 
Balantine recites quietly:
    "Shall you take courage and pay the cost?
      For ships at sea are often tossed
      Or in safe harbor will you stay?
      Abandon risk to seek safe play?"


Balantine recites quietly:
    "For nothing ventured nothing gained
      Can your emotions keep contained?
      Or will you cower in trembling fear?
      When rumors of nearing death you hear?"

 
Balantine recites quietly:
    "Will you choose to defend the meek?
      Or with the crowd do you hide and seek?
      Choose your poison which to drink
      Learn to swim and not to sink"

Balantine recites quietly:
    "For life comes to all but once
      The wise man chooses, not the dunce
      Will you years from now regret your fate?
      And in obscurity your choices hate?"


 
Balantine recites quietly:
    "Now lies opportunity in your grasp
      So seize the day and do not gasp
      At others' deeds and widespread fame
      For there is time to make your name"
 
Balantine recites quietly:
    "Will you train when others rest?
      Will you learn to be your best?
      For there is time enough to sleep
      When breath is gone, and night is deep"


Balantine tilts his head down.
Balantine bows.

Speaking to Balantine, you say, "Thank you Sir."
 
You say, "Please everyone give us a moment while the judges discuss the scores."

You stand back up.
 
You say, "First, I would just take a moment of you time to once again thank you for attending. I am certain that both Drung and Elbromo would have certainly enjoyed the tales shared tonight."

You say, "Let us raise a glass in their memory."

You say, "I would suggest the stout."

You pour yourself a stein of dwarven stout.

Gutstorm raises his invar dwarven stein in a toast and proclaims:
    "While we are here, let us enjoy this drink so dear, and for those who are not, let them know they'll ne'er be forgot."
 
You lay your palm across the arching symbol of two knotwork grizzly bears on your vultite brooch, your fingers curling around the vultite edges, and bow your head in a moment of respect for all those that have come before you, for all those who have fallen at your side, and for those that are yet to come.


You say, "Now, I am sure you are all eager to hear the final scores, but before we do. As I mentioned earlier, we are celebrating our thirtieth anniversary this year."
 
You loudly state, "Our Founding celebration will continue on the 16th of next month. The Twilight Gallery in Vornavis will be hosting a collection of artifacts of the Order. Join us as we walk through and display historic items."

      
You say, "We thank the Gallery of course, for hosting our modest collection."
 
Speaking appreciatively to you, Missoni says, "Oh, it is hardly modest."

You exclaim, "Something to look forward to!"


You say, "Now, this was a difficult year for the judges. Dare I say, more so than prior years."

You exclaim, "In third place, we have Squire Delindra!"

You exclaim, "In second place tonight. Morandas!"

You say, "Finally, in first place."

You exclaim, "Alosaka!"

You exclaim, "Thank you to all of our competitors, and especially, let us thank the Herald and Bathcwyn for their additional performances tonight!"
