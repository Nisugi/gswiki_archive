Cryheart smiles at Athalia.

Cryheart says, "It would be my honor."

Athalia offers Cryheart a small smile, her eyes linging just a moment longer than needed.

Dunrith says, "Captain Gurbah has selected the members of the Guard who will be accompanying us to Lolle.  We know will be in the safest of hands."

An aged chamberlain says, "His Excelleny will not be taking petitions from those present here in the Court.  Any of those wishing to address his Excellency should make their intentions known to Captain Gurbah.  Names will then be called to stand before the Court."

An aged chamberlain says, "Given the schedule of His Excellency not all petitions may be heard at this time."

An aged chamberlain says, "The Court will hear the petition of one Maylan of the House White Haven."

Maylan says, "Greetings. I am Land Pirate Maylan, master of the healing arts and representative of House White Haven."

(Maylan huffs on her White Haven bear head pin and buffs it clean with her sleeve.)

Maylan says, "I come with a message. We stand in solidarity with the people of Talador, and all those affected by the recent tragedies."

Maylan says, "House White Haven wishes to host a benefit for the relief efforts, to demonstrate our neighborly good-will."

Dunrith says, "We appreciate these warm words of support."

Speaking to Kasendra, Maylan says, "You say that winter has hindered your progress. Let the land of winter in Icemule Trace support you."

Kasendra says, "Very kind of you and your house."

Maylan says, "In one week's time, I invite all to take the polar plunge with House White Haven. We will accept all manner of donations on behalf of Lady Kasendra."
Speaking to herself, Maylan says, "Now where did I put the..."

Dunrith says, "We have been told of the many donations that have been received thus far to support the effort.  That your House is willing to join with them is most generous."

Maylan works her fingers under her death mask and scratches her head.

Maylan says, "Ah yes."

Speaking to Kasendra, Maylan says, "We wish to present you with a gift."

Maylan offers Kasendra a frosted glass bottle with an arctic blue stopper.

Speaking to Kasendra, Maylan says, "This is a scent known only to our fine house. May you think of us when the winds of winter blow your way."

Kasendra accepts Maylan's glass bottle.

Maylan fidgets.

Kasendra says, "Thank you."

Kasendra curtsies gracefully.

Maylan says, "That is all."

Maylan bows low, spreading her wings for all to see.

(Maylan resumes her place with the crowd.)

An aged chamberlain says, "Next to petition this Court is Sir Cryheart Thaxin, Knight Banneret of the Turamzyrrian Empire, and member of the Order of the Silver Gryphons."

Cryheart coughs.

Cryheart strides over to stand before Dunrith.

Cryheart bows to Dunrith.

Dunrith smiles at Cryheart.

Cryheart says, "Your Excellency."

Cryheart says, "I respectfully request to court your daughter, Lady Athalia."

Cryheart coughs.

Rowmi turns to Cryheart and cheers!

Katiesa looks at Cryheart and hums.

Nadene fans herself.

Athalia sits up a bit more formally, focusing her attention on the knight speaking.

Dunrith says, "Sir Thaxin.  It is always a pleasure to have you here with us at Court."

Evrali glances between Cryheart and Athalia.

Cryheart bows to Dunrith.

Salnim gives Athalia a glance from the side of his eye.

Speaking to Cryheart, Dunrith says, "We have long heard tale of the many brave deeds and actions you have taken on behalf of Vornavis, the Landing, and innocent people."

Athalia sighs softly, her shoulders sinking just a touch.

Speaking to Cryheart, Dunrith says, "But we must admit that taking such a step here before this Court, with these many people present certainly does stand out as a brave deed."

Cryheart says, "She gives me the courage."

Goldstr agrees with Dunrith.

Cryheart says, "Your Excellency."

Athalia blushes a delicate shade of pale pink.

Dunrith says, "She has ever been a source of inspiration for great things."

Kasendra smiles.

Cryheart says, "Aye your Excellency."

Speaking quickly to Dunrith, Rowmi blurts, "Well?!"

Rowmi blushes a bright soft pale rose to the tops of his ears.

An aged chamberlain frowns.

Kayse's shoulders shake subtly as she turns away from Rowmi, while struggling to compose her features, revealing a glimmer of mirth before returning to a poker face.

Cryheart says, "I recall the first task you gave me to display my chivarly towards your daughter, a long time ago."

Cryheart says, "The attraction has grown greatly."

Cryheart says, "With respect."

Cryheart bows.

Dunrith says, "We have long known that our daughter is a woman of remarkable means and more than capable of making her own judgements in matters of importance."

Athalia anxiously glances over at the Baron, her lip biten fretfully.

Dunrith says, "And long have we seen, heard, and known the character of you, Sir Thaxin."

Dunrith says, "To that end, you have our permission to formally court our daughter."

Rowmi applauds with enthusiasm, seemingly oblivious to his surroundings.

Limorten adopts an agreeable expression.

Bristenn applauds politely.

Ysharra sniffs.

Kayse applauds Cryheart loudly.

Athalia softly says, "It is our wish as well."

Athalia smiles at Dunrith.

Cryheart says, "My thanks your Excellency."

(More clapping..)

You grin.

Speaking to Cryheart, Gurbah says, "Knight Cryheart."

Cryheart turns to face Gurbah.

Cryheart says, "Aye, Captain Gurbah."

Dirra folds her hands behind her back.

Speaking to Cryheart, Gurbah says, "You break Lady's heart.  Gurbah break skull."

Gurbah nods at Cryheart.

Rowmi begins chuckling at Gurbah!

Cryheart gulps.

Shinann grins.

Talinvor cackles!

Mynon appears to be trying hard not to grin.

Ysharra begins chuckling at Gurbah!

Kayse begins chuckling at Gurbah!

Cryheart says, "I can imagine."

Salnim glances around the dais and laughs.

Athalia wags her finger at Gurbah, a small smile lifting her lips.

Cryheart says, "As a display of my loyalty to the Lady Athalia."

Cryheart says, "I still wear the ribbon she gave me during that task."

Cryheart nods at Dunrith.

Cryheart taps a silver-edged emerald hair ribbon that he is wearing.

Athalia beams happily at Cryheart!

Cryheart smiles at Athalia.

Speaking to Cryheart, Dunrith says, "A fact that has not ever escaped our notice, Sir Thaxin."

An aged chamberlain asks, "Was there anything further you had to upend the Court, Sir Cryheart?"

Cryheart shakes his head at an aged chamberlain.

(The crowd laughs)

An aged chamberlain says, "Then the Court thanks you for your petition, and maintaining proper decorum."

Cryheart smiles at Athalia.

Cryheart bows to an aged chamberlain.

(Cryheart steps back.)

An aged chamberlain seems to mutter a few things to himself.

An aged chamberlain says, "The next petition before the Court is one Kayse Thaellian.  She has a matter of importance for His Excellency."

(Kayse takes a few confident steps to the front of the crowd, she gives a short respectful nod to the group sitting on the dais, before steading her gaze.)

Kayse formally introduces, "My name is Kayse Thaellian--I suppose I am best known for how I spin a tale, as well as being an officer within the House of the Arcane."

Kayse simply continues, "I have been on a few supply runs to the relief camp.  One of the times a tree had fallen in our path--this was before the heavier snow.  I suppose it could have fallen on its own...but I had a feeling we were being watched as we cleared the area."

Kayse carefully mentions, "This most recent trip, on the way back a few days ago, the wagon came to a sudden halt.  More debris in the path--but this time, rocks, branches...it appeared man made."

Dunrith gazes with interest at Kayse.

Kasendra frowns.

Kayse slowly says, "When we finished clearing the road, a crossbow bolt shattered against the side of the wagon and a voice rang out..."

Kasendra gasps.

Kayse folds her wings across her back.

Salnim turns an inquisitive ear toward Kayse.

Kayse quotes, "Ya all have a nice safe trip home now.  It be dangerous of here.  Best be watching where you stray."

Kayse cautiously notes, "I am not sure if Duvernith was able to send word in time, but we believe they weren't wishing to rob the wagon, but were looking for a person."

Kasendra says, "That is terrible."

Kasendra frowns.

Speaking to Dunrith, Kayse says, "For future supply runs, I think we should be on our highest alert--but most importantly anyone of importance heading in or out of the camp."

Dunrith says, "We were made aware of this, however the details of the report were few.  Thus we were hoping to hear from one present during this incident for ourselves."

Kayse nods understandingly at Dunrith.

Dunrith says, "For that we thank you for bringing this matter out into the open."

Kasendra nods at Martohck.

Dunrith says, "We are in agreement in urging caution."

Kayse politely says, "I am glad it was made aware to you.  Thank you for your audience.  I hope whoever is responsible can be caught before something happens besides a road block."

Dunrith says, "An incident like this does make us wonder who or what might be responsible, and furthermore why."
Kayse nods in agreement at Dunrith.

Kasendra adopts an agreeable expression.

Dunrith says, "However we appear to be lacking in this information at this time.  Thus our steps forward must be in caution."

Bekke asks, "Pardon me. If I may offer a .. thought?"

Speaking to Dunrith, Kayse offers, "All we can do moving forward is to exercise caution and hope we learn more."

Kayse glances over her shoulder at Bekke.

Speaking to Salnim, Dunrith says, "We recommend Captain Gurbah and you liase with Lady Kasendra and Captain Martohck to investigate this incident and take the necessary precautions."

Salnim nods at Dunrith.

Kasendra nods.

(Kayse's eyes shift across each member on the dais, observing every detail she can.)

Dunrith says, "We are dealing with sovereign territories and thus cannot simply dispatch the Guard and be done with it."

Salnim says, "We will see what can be found out, father."

Kasendra agrees with Salnim.

Kasendra says, "We will."

Dunrith nods.

Kayse nods once at Dunrith.

An aged chamberlain says, "Thank you for your petition before the Court."

(Kayse turns abruptly back towards the crowd and makes her way back to her spot.)

An aged chamberlain says, "Our next petition before the Court is one Sir Bristenn Mires, Knight of the Empire and member of the Order of the Azure Suns."

Bristenn confidently strides a few steps forward.

Bristenn bows low, abasing himself before all.

Bristenn formally observes, "My lords, my ladies, captains."

Speaking to Bristenn, Dunrith says, "We are ever gladdened to have you here before, Sir Mires."

Bristenn clearly replies, "It is my honor, my liege, to serve this fair barony and her noble house."

Bristenn slowly begins, "However, what I bring to this court is less of glad tidings- it, in fact, hinged 'pon the witnesses of the incidents along the caravan trail."

Dunrith gazes with interest at Bristenn.

Bristenn confidently offers, "Given that these are sovreign terri'tries and provincial borders, and that the Guard cannot be dispatched, I submit the Order of the Azure Sun to task on this troubling news."

Bristenn evenly adds, "We are few in number, my liege, yet I am confident we can bring about a resolution without the situation escalating moreso."

Bristenn respectfully assures, "We are at your leave, sire, and that of your house, and will do our mortal finest."

Bristenn bows respectfully, his eyes fixed firmly on the ground.

Speaking to Bristenn, Dunrith says, "We also would berift to mention that dispatching you on our behalf when we could not dispatch our own men, still can result in issues of sovereignty.  To that end we know that you will, as ever, step carefully in this matter."

Mynon nods reassuringly.

Bristenn sincerely agrees, "Rather, your Excellency."

Salnim says, "I am sure we can find a use for Sir Mires, father."

Salnim nods at Bristenn.

Bristenn nods gravely, clasping his hands behind his back.

Bristenn clearly concedes, "That is all I had for this honorable court, save my humblest thanks for but a moment of the floor."

Athalia smiles at Bristenn.

Dirra smiles proudly.

An aged chamberlain says, "The Court thanks you for your honorable petition, Sir Mires."

Bristenn inclines his head.

Bristenn bows respectfully, his eyes fixed firmly on the ground.

Bristenn takes a few steps back.

An aged chamberlain says, "That was the final petition we had for the Court, Your Excellency."

Dunrith inclines his head.

Dunrith nods to the aged chamberlain.

Dunrith says, "Thank you Lord Chamberlain."

Dunrith says, "Before we end this session of Court, we have one more thing to make mention."

Dunrith says, "In light of this recent news, we believe it is in the best interests of this Court, and the Relief Effort, to hold a court session again in the future to update on this matter."

You adopt an agreeable expression.

Dunrith says, "While we will be away visiting Lolle, we hearby instruct Lord Salnim Malwind to hold Court in our stead."

Salnim nods at Dunrith.

Speaking to Dunrith, Salnim says, "I will try to not burn the Hall down while you are gone, father."

Dunrith shakes his head.

[Vornavis, Great Hall]
On a low dais, spanning the southern end of the hall, three regal chairs of state rest before an embroidered tapestry of the Rising Swan of Vornavis that covers the wall behind them.  Banners bearing the coats-of-arms of knights in service to the barony hang from the railing of the second floor gallery that lines the other three sides of the Great Hall.

[Solhaven, Esplanade Gate]
A swan of white ora sits on the green copper gates, proclaiming them an entrance into Vornavis.  Around them stands a huge granite wall, protecting the inhabitants of the city from all intruders.  Citizens move through the gates under the careful eye of the guard standing in front of the portal.  You also see the Dannai disk, a tidal jaguar, a reinforced sally gate and a guard.
