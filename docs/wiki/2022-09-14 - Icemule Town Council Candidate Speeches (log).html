Banners of blue and white frame a mule-printed tent flap marking the entrance to the spacious pavilion.  Supported by a central pillar of hoarbeam that is heavily carved with penguins, polar bears, and wolves, the enclosed space is heated and perfumed by a number of pierced censers hanging from the support beams by chains of iron.  The eastern quadrant of the pavilion is dominated by a raised pine stage festooned with blue and white banners with a weathered spruce podium at the front.
</p><p>Rammael just came out of a mule-printed tent flap.
</p><p>Jiarine removes a piece of ebon parchment from in her black leather longcoat.
</p><p>Rammael bows.
</p><p><b>Rammael says, "Good evening, all."</b>
</p><p>Jiarine focuses all of her attention on her parchment, writing carefully with her quill.  Satisfied, she considers what she's written.
</p><p>Nodyre nods to Rammael in greeting.
</p><p>Vaemyr nods to Rammael in greeting.
</p><p>Jiarine offers Nodyre a piece of ebon parchment.
</p><p>Randsford bows to Rammael.
</p><p>Bakarus examines Rammael closely, sizing him up and taking note of all the details.
</p><p>With straightened posture and a firm chin, Sorlu presents himself to Rammael with a short, courteous bow.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in greeting at Rammael.
</p><p>Bakarus nods in greeting at Rammael.
</p><p>Trouthe nods to Rammael in greeting.
</p><p>Drawing her left leg behind her right, Teaberry briefly dips into a respectful curtsy before Rammael and bows her head.
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>Roelon nods at Rammael.
</p><p>Trouthe put a piece of ebon parchment in her fur cloak.
</p><p>Jiarine assures, "Everything will be by the book."
</p><p>Jiarine offers Nodyre a piece of ebon parchment.
</p><p>Nodyre raises an eyebrow in Jiarine's direction.
</p><p>Nodyre accepts Jiarine's ebon parchment.
</p><p>Jiarine appears to be trying hard not to grin.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Here is to speak yir case."
</p><p>Nodyre chuckles.
</p><p>Roelon grins at Nodyre.
</p><p>Nodyre offers Jiarine a piece of ebon parchment.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "And having Jia here, trying to bribe, via a note, should automatically have her disqualified."
</p><p>Fropple gasps.
</p><p>Jiarine shakes her head at Gespry and clucks her tongue.
</p><p>Fropple exclaims, "Bribe, very very dire accusation!"
</p><p>Fropple rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p><b>Rammael says, "Well, I hope everyone is prepared to make their respective cases."</b>
</p><p>Nodyre nods at Rammael.
</p><p>Jiarine snidely asks, "Since when have politics been savory?"
</p><p>Sorlu adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>Roelon rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Teaberry says, "This should be very interesting."
</p><p>Roelon nods at Teaberry.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Very."
</p><p><b>Rammael says, "I am, unfortunately, a bit under the weather this evening."</b>
</p><p>Bakarus says, "Good luck to all.  Undoubtedly I could have won again as the preeminent council member, but in the interest of healing and putting Icemule first..."
</p><p>Bakarus says, "I have decided not to run."
</p><p>Speaking to Rammael, Nodyre says, "Sorry to hear that."
</p><p>Roelon nods slowly.
</p><p>Bakarus nods respectfully.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Gespry, Rammael asks, "Would you be amenable to assisting in managing the speeches?"</b>
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "The weather has been ah bit colder then usual."
</p><p>Gespry ponders.
</p><p>Gespry nods at Rammael.
</p><p>Roelon nods at Gespry.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically asks, "Ok, shall we get this done?"</b>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="--NODYRE_SPEECH--">--NODYRE SPEECH--</span></h2>
<p><b>Gespry melodically says, "First up is Commodire Nodyre the Gamb..err.gamesman."</b>
</p><p><i>You see Commodore Nodyre the Gambler.</i>
</p><p><i>He appears to be a Half-Sylvan.</i>
</p><p><i>He is very tall and has a lithesome, nimble build.  He appears to be time-worn.  He has piercing emerald-hued eyes and faintly lined, windburnt skin.  He has short, sandy blonde hair threaded with grey at the temples.  He has prominent biceps.</i>
</p><p><i>He has an enruned gold-inked band on his finger, and an ethereal kut'zikokra tattoo.</i>
</p><p><i>He is wearing a broad-brimmed bycocket topped with an exceptionally long snow petrel plume, a cloak, an intricate vaalorn aegis with a crystal chamber embedded in its focus slung over his shoulder, a subdued scabbard slung over his other shoulder, a duffel bag, a harness over a long-sleeved shirt, some disc armor, some vambraces, a herringbone palm frond wristband, a white aegis-crested black ora ring, an unadorned ring, a subdued sash, a coin pouch, an herb kit, a pair of cuffed trousers, an intricate vaalorn quiver affixed with a complex dial just above its open mouth, and an unremarkable pair of boots.</i>
</p><p>Gespry nods at Nodyre.
</p><p>Nodyre frowns at Gespry.
</p><p>Roelon grins slowly.
</p><p>Nodyre coughs.
</p><p>(Gespry steps aside to the cart.)
</p><p>With a couple quick shoves, Nodyre tucks his shirt into his trousers.
</p><p>Nodyre glances down at his pair of cuffed trousers with a slight frown, and then briefly tugs at the waistband.  After a few adjustments to the fabric and how it drapes about his hips, he seems satisfied.
</p><p>Nodyre adjusts his subdued sash, moving a lasimor-throated scabbard and a bleakstone-throated scabbard until he is satisfied.
</p><p>Nodyre narrows his eyes, then suddenly steps purposefully forward, letting his cloak billow behind him.
</p><p>Nodyre deftly tilts his head and lets the bycocket roll off his head and into his awaiting hand.
</p><p><b>Nodyre says, "Greetings. I am Nodyre, longtime resident of Icemule Trace and Captain of The Nautical by Nature."</b>
</p><p><b>Nodyre says, "First and foremost, I'd like to thank Rammael for providing me with this opportunity to speak with all of you."</b>
</p><p>Pulling up the edges of his cloak, Nodyre executes a stately bow.
</p><p><b>Nodyre says, "I'd also like to thank all of those in attendance for taking the time out of their busy day to ensure that Icemule Trace has competent and engaged leadership in place."</b>
</p><p><b>Nodyre says, "My policy goals are simple."</b>
</p><p><b>Nodyre says, "First, I aim to establish port access for our town in order to open up new trade routes and to establish proper defense to our west. I also seek to establish mount trails from here to the Hinterwilds."</b>
</p><p>Nodyre scratches at the lining of his cloak, releasing a salty sea scent into the air.
</p><p>Jiarine sneezes, trying vainly to keep from spraying you.
</p><p>Gespry nods slowly.
</p><p><b>Nodyre says, "Second, I look to audit the town finances to weed out graft, corruption, and negligence."</b>
</p><p>Gespry winces as a dusty twilight grey mouse snuffles along his neck, pausing to dig its nose into his ear.
</p><p>Bakarus smiles at Jiarine.
</p><p>Sorlu frowns at Jiarine.
</p><p>Jiarine whispers aloud, "He smells."
</p><p><b>Nodyre says, "Third - and by far the most daunting of my goals - I will bring to justice the villain murdering our residents and befouling the corpses with Luukosian deathwort."</b>
</p><p>Gespry nods approvingly.
</p><p>Nodyre strikes a commanding pose, throwing his cloak back and staring off into the distance.
</p><p>Roelon nods once.
</p><p>Sorlu smirks at Jiarine.
</p><p><b>Nodyre says, "By electing me to the Town Council you can be confident that your safety and fortunes will be secured and good governance will be enforced."</b>
</p><p><b>Nodyre says, "Thank you for your consideration."</b>
</p><p>Nodyre catches the lip of his broad-brimmed bycocket and flips it up into the air.  Without missing a beat he catches it on his head.
</p><p>Nodyre nods at Gespry.
</p><p>Jiarine applauds.
</p><p>Aliashyrah applauds politely.
</p><p>Trouthe applauds Nodyre.
</p><p>Jiarine unsuccessfully stifles a yawn, then attempts to recover by vigorously applauding!
</p><p>Roelon applauds.
</p><p>Sorlu nods.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "Thanks Nodyre, is there any questions.  please raise yer hand."</b>
</p><p>Jiarine raises her hand.
</p><p>Gespry nods at Jiarine.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically asks, "What is you question, Jiarine?"</b>
</p><p><b>Jiarine asks, "Exactly how do you plan to bring about all of these large changes when the council cannot do much of anything at this point?"</b>
</p><p>Trouthe glances at Jiarine.
</p><p>Nodyre rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Jiarine, Nodyre says, "A good question."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu smiles.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Jiarine, Nodyre says, "I would bring to the council a notable amount of wealth, a fleet of ships, and a lifetime of experience."</b>
</p><p><b>Gespry grins impishly.</b>
</p><p>Jiarine says, "A good audit could have discovered where the missing silver has vanished months ago before it could have been buried even further into the depths of who knows where."<b></b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Jiarine, Nodyre says, "I also, as an office in the Hand of the Arkati, have enormous influence with some of the most reputable and disreputable adventurers around. You can rest assured that when I speak, I speak with a very loud voice."</b>
</p><p><b>Jiarine asks, "Oh... by simply being old and rich by your standards you are automatically the better choice?"</b>
</p><p>Jiarine says, "Got it."<b></b>
</p><p>Sorlu appears to be trying hard not to grin.
</p><p><b>Bakarus says, "As a concerned citizen, certain unpleasant steps must be taken to accomplish such goals, many the citizenry find not palatable...but likely necessary.  The killer has evaded all efforts with ease thus far...besides one overachieving gardner."</b>
</p><p>Rammael chuckles quietly.
</p><p>Vaemyr snickers.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Bakarus, Nodyre says, "It's a good thing that I don't fight fair."</b>
</p><p>As Nodyre reaches for his kut'zikokra tattoo an ethereal crossbow stock protrudes from its center.  He grabs the crossbow stock and pulls an ethereal kut'zikokra out.
</p><p>Nodyre cocks his ethereal kut'zikokra.
</p><p>A series of ethereal chains lashes out from Nodyre's kut'zikokra tattoo as his ethereal kut'zikokra seeps back into his tattoo.
</p><p><b>Speaking melodically to Bakarus, Gespry asks, "That a comment or question?"</b>
</p><p>Sorlu rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Gespry, Bakarus says, "Merely a comment."</b>
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically asks, "Any other questions?"</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Nodyre, Teaberry asks, "How is not fighting fair a recommendation?"</b>
</p><p>Teaberry acts puzzled.
</p><p>Missoni bites her lip.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Teaberry, Nodyre says, "I'm not sure I follow the question."</b>
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "The Council should be above the law at all times."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu looks thoughtfully at Jiarine.
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "Otherwise it weakens the entire city."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah helpfully reminds, "And disreputable connections."
</p><p>Vaemyr glances at Jiarine.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Nodyre, Teaberry asks, "You just said it was a good thing that you didn't fight fair. How is not fighting fair a good thing?"</b>
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "As an aside, this is just a few followup question for the electorial choices, this is not time for a long debate."</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Teaberry, Nodyre asks, "How has fighting fair worked so far with the murderer running around?"</b>
</p><p>Gespry nods once.
</p><p>Bakarus nods understandingly.
</p><p>Teaberry frowns.
</p><p>Gespry bows to Nodyre.
</p><p>Nodyre nods at Gespry.
</p><p><b>Speaking melodically to Nodyre, Gespry says, "Thanks, if we have time after everyone has gone, if you want to expound or add to your comments or interests, then do so then."</b>
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="--JIARINE_SPEECH--">--JIARINE SPEECH--</span></h2>
<p><b>Gespry melodically says, "Next up, is the lady Jiarine D'Nerval."</b>
</p><p><i>You see Jiarine D'Nerval Nalfein the Keeper of the Secret.</i>
</p><p><i>She appears to be an Elf.</i>
</p><p><i>She is diminutive and has a delicately boned, waifish body.  She appears to be youthful.  She has lash draped topaz-encircled brilliant cyan eyes and velvety smooth alabaster skin.  She has chin length, silky ebonwood-hued hair with longer layers of fiery gold and umber framing her face.  She has a finely boned gracile face and narrow ears that curve sharply upward into delicate, angled points.  She has bronze-hazed chocolate polish brushed onto her oval fingernails.</i>
</p><p><i>Undecipherable sigils are branded onto her fingertips, their edges emanating a dull black glow.</i>
</p><p><i>She is in good shape.</i>
</p><p><i>She is wearing a knee-length black leather longcoat, a suede-strapped sturdy leather rucksack, a side-laced dark leather underbust corset over a low-necked dark chocolate blouse, a short ebony lace skirt draped with a glass-beaded fringe, and some tall ebony side-strapped boots.</i>
</p><p>Gespry nods at Jiarine.
</p><p>Jiarine drops into a deep curtsy, moving smoothly as her arms sweep grandly to her sides.
</p><p>Bakarus turns to face Jiarine.
</p><p>Sorlu skeptically mouths, "Lady?"
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles to himself.
</p><p>Roelon holds up his hand and tilts it side to side in a so-so gesture.
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "My heart is sad since I did not get such a grand naming."</b>
</p><p>Roelon nods at Sorlu.
</p><p>Missoni turns an inquisitive ear toward Jiarine.
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "Some of you do not know me and if you have heard of me... the truth is more than the words other would have spoken."</b>
</p><p>Roelon grins.
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "I do not claim to play above the law but I will follow the courses set by those who know better while voicing my concerns the entire time."</b>
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "This town needs someone who will not blindly follow and can keep a clear head of the bigger picture that involves the people of this town."</b>
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "If I am voted onto this council you know what I would bring to this table.  Insight into politics years in the making within my own City."</b>
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "I would also not shy away from the "hard" tasks that will surely be coming in the future as the root of the problems here are brought into the light."</b>
</p><p>Jiarine shrugs.
</p><p>Perigourd raises an eyebrow.
</p><p><b>Speaking melodically to Jiarine, Gespry asks, "All done?"</b>
</p><p>Bakarus applauds.
</p><p>Rammael walks off into the distance.
</p><p>Roelon applauds.
</p><p>Gespry chuckles.
</p><p>Speaking to Gespry, Sorlu says, "Please make it be."
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "My only request is that those who vote do it with who they think can bring the most and not whose voice is the most annoying."</b>
</p><p>Nodyre raises an eyebrow.
</p><p>Sorlu grins.
</p><p>Jiarine makes a flicking motion with her wrist and a tiny fiery glow briefly appears in her hand.
</p><p>Roelon grins.
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles to himself.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically asks, "Thank you Jiarine for you stepping up to toss your name into the council election.  Does anyone here have a question for Jiarine?"</b>
</p><p>Gespry surveys the area.
</p><p>Teaberry raises her hand.
</p><p>Gespry nods at Teaberry.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "Ok, Teaberry."</b>
</p><p>Jiarine cocks her head at Teaberry.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Jiarine, Teaberry asks, "What hard tasks do you foresee coming in the future?"</b>
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "There is still something simmering beneath our feet and the darkness will come again."</b>
</p><p>Gespry nods slowly.
</p><p>Randsford raises an eyebrow.
</p><p>Sorlu raises an eyebrow.
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "A murderer walks freely amoung you and I."</b>
</p><p>Roelon rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Nodyre nods at Jiarine.
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "Someone knows who that is."</b>
</p><p>Missoni casually observes her surroundings.
</p><p>Teaberry nods slowly.
</p><p>Bakarus glances around the room.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically asks, "Anyone else?"</b>
</p><p>Bakarus shrugs.
</p><p>Rammael frowns.
</p><p>Trouthe agrees with Jiarine.
</p><p>Sorlu whispers aloud, "Is she threatening us?"
</p><p>Sorlu squints.
</p><p>Randsford raises his hand.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Sadly,  aye. Fir all we know, is watchin' us still as we all speak."
</p><p>Gespry looks over at Sorlu and shakes his head.
</p><p>Sorlu glances at Gespry.
</p><p>Sorlu touches one finger to his lips.
</p><p>Jiarine asks, "Did I offer to burn your ass?"
</p><p>Sorlu appears to be trying hard not to grin.
</p><p>Jiarine squints at Sorlu.
</p><p>Roelon slowly empties his lungs.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Lets keep it civil."
</p><p>Speaking to Jiarine, Sorlu says, "Not tonight."
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Jiarine.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Jiarine, Randsford asks, "In the past you said you did not care if the lich won or lost.  Why would you suddenly care what happens to this town?"</b>
</p><p>Jiarine says, "Then you are not threatened."
</p><p>Gespry bows to Jiarine.
</p><p>Aliashyrah gazes with interest at Randsford.

<p><b>Gespry sings melodically:</b>
</p>
<pre>   "Next up is Lord Sorlu Jae'kym the previous tablet bearer"<b></b>
</pre>
<p><br/>
<i>You see Lord Sorlu Jae'kym the Scoundrel.</i>
</p><p><i>He appears to be a Nalfein Elf.</i>
</p><p><i>He is average height.  He appears to be extremely young.  He has icily translucent, frost blue eyes and fair skin.  He has shoulder length, thick battle-touseled sable hair and a wide-brimmed black suede hat stuck with a single raven black feather worn at a rakish angle.  He has an angular face, a classical nose and long pointed ears.  A long smoky emerald feather quill tipped with a spiraled dark vaalin nib is tucked behind his ear.</i>
</p><p><i>He has an interwoven infinity symbol tattoo on his neck, inked wispy tendrils of smoky jade curling sensually around both forearms, a menacing jade-eyed onyx viper tattoo on his arm, a faintly serrated sliver of emerald with prismatic striations in his left eyebrow, and a wisp-wrapped blonde woman tattoo on his arm.</i>
</p><p><i>Elongated tentacles of hazy jade mist writhe across his form, undulating in rhythm to his movements.</i>
</p><p><i>He is in good shape.</i>
</p><p><i>He is holding a slender Nalfein-styled cane in his right hand.</i>
<i>He is wearing a mithril-edged vultite buckler inset with thick steel knobs, a sleek midnight suede rucksack stitched with gleaming silver thread, a shadowy black marbrinus cloak clasped with a pure jet rose, a black highwayman coat with an elbow-length capelet, a half-buttoned ivory linen shirt, a crescent platinum torc ending in shadowglass-eyed rat heads, an emerald talisman etched with a wispy smoke-wrapped woman, a verdigris ivy leaf-shaped locket, a white stone seed charm, some tailored black leather gloves, a brushed platinum wedding band of two intertwined figures worn on the left ring finger, a pair of soft black suede trousers finished with onyx rivets, an oiled leather belt, a soft leather coin bag bound with veniom, a rugged leather loot bag, a tarnished brass keyring, and some black leather boots with obsidian-tipped laces.</i>
</p><p>Gespry nods at Sorlu.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Gespry.
</p><p>Roelon nods.
</p><p>Sorlu takes a few steps toward a weathered spruce podium.
</p><p>Bakarus nods at Sorlu.
</p><p>Gespry skips happily towards a vine-carved cherrywood cart.
</p><p>Gespry turns an inquisitive ear toward Sorlu.
</p><p>(Sorlu turns toward the crowd.)
</p><p><b>Sorlu greets, "Good evening, Icemule. Do forgive the speed in which I speak, as I have much to say and little time to deliver it..."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu smiles politely.
</p><p>Teaberry nods.
</p><p><b>Sorlu begins, "Ah, well... here we are again."</b>
</p><p>Randsford nods in agreement at Bakarus.
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles to himself.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "It seems it were not long ago that I was standing before you, trying to earn the confidence of your vote.  But sadly, it was not to be..."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu frowns.
</p><p><b>Sorlu laments, "It would seem that not enough of you were able to find value in what I offered. Regardless of the many who have since come to me to speak otherwise, as well as the shattering of our Council, the stagnation of our town, and a serial killer remaining on the loose...I still do not consider this to be your failing. No, my friends, it was I that failed you..."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu sighs.
</p><p>Sorlu nods slowly.
</p><p>Rammael turns an inquisitive ear toward Sorlu.
</p><p>Nodyre laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "Perhaps I was not able to express to you the seriousness of the situation. Or perhaps I failed to overcome the known bigotry and suspicion that exists towards those of my House, as well as those of my faith.  But as they say, this is water under the bridge. A past that can't be changed... but one that has hopefully since been overcome."</b>
</p><p><b>Sorlu continues, "The last time I spoke, I offered many examples of the programs and civic changes that I would introduce. These have not changed.."</b>
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "Should I be elected, the first thing that will be instituted is a mandatory monthly Town Council meeting that is open for the public to attend. These meetings will allow the Council to provide updates to the town, as well as receive feedback or suggestions in a more formal manner.  While I understand that at times certain individual members of the Council might not be able to attend due to personal affairs, these monthly meetings will take place without fail...perhaps upon the ides of each month. Somehow this feels appropriate, though I am flexible as to allow for as many to attend as possible."</b>
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "Second, a call will be sent out to all banners. Throughout Icemule's history, many fabled militias have been formed...sadly, the remnants of each lay currently scattered. For there to be a safe Icemule, a new unified militia needs to be formed out of these remnants. Such a militia will need it's own leadership, one that is separate from the Town Council...though I'm quite sure all on the Council are willing to serve our town by joining as irregulars. Once I'm elected, interviews will begin immediately for those with interest in helping to establish and lead this new force..which will be expected to maintain meetings and practice drills."</b>
</p><p>Nodyre cringes.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "My third point, the process of which will also begin immediately upon my election, is the formation of a formal outreach program. While we have the defensive luxury of being so far isolated from the south and the east...the wise know that ignorance of information is often one's great vulnerability. And truly, such vulnerabilities need to be addressed..."</b>
</p><p>Missoni looks thoughtfully at Sorlu.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "Many of you already have established relationships with other towns outside the reach of the northern cold. It is to you I will turn for this third point, those of you who might find interest in becoming official ambassadors and emissaries of Icemule. Again, we will select from those who do not already have their time consumed by maintaining a seat on the Council. Through this program, we will learn who is a friend to Icemule, and who is not. This knowledge will open up a spectrum of future possibilities as well...from establishing new trade partners to the creation of foreign military alliances. Opening the channels of communication with other communities in an official manner will help to establish Icemule as the power that we truly are."</b>
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "I could go on for hours...but as you can well see, my entire platform consists of strengthening our community ties, and thus strengthening the town. I don't seek your vote through simple wordplay, smiles and... giggles. But instead through actual executable plans that set up roles for each and every one of you, should you desire it.."</b>
</p><p><b>Sorlu slyly adds, "And trust me, you will quite enjoy many of the other things I have in mind as well..."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu grins slowly.
</p><p><b>Sorlu urges, "Now...I will ask that you think back over the last few years, and all I have done to protect this town. Consider the burden I was made to carry, the personal risk I accepted so that we might buy ourselves time to find a way to fight back. Even in the face of an enemy that was nearly overwhelming, my loyalty did not waiver.. not even when I was offered a throne from which to rule over this town."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu casually glances around the room.
</p><p><b>Sorlu concludes, "My friends, I do not seek to rule over you...because I am one of you. That is not the job of the Council, nor any governing body. No...It is our job to serve you, the good people of this town. If what I say appeals to you, place my name, Sorlu Jae'kym, on your ballot."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu nods.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "Thank you."</b>
</p><p>Gespry nods at Sorlu.
</p><p>Roelon rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Trouthe applauds Sorlu.
</p><p>Vaemyr nods at Sorlu.
</p><p>Aliashyrah applauds Sorlu politely.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically asks, "Any quick questions for Sorlu?"</b>

</p><p><b>Speaking to Sorlu, Nodyre asks, "And is there some sort of penalty for not attending?"</b>
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "Those who wish to attend, can...and those who do not..."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu shrugs.

</p><p>Roelon grins at Jiarine.
</p><p>Nodyre gazes heavenward.
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "You plan to do this.  You plan that.  You will arrange for even more."</b>
</p><p>Jiarine says, "That sounds like someone out for themselves."
</p><p><b>Speaking to Jiarine, Sorlu says, "Because we are presenting what it is we wish to do to help better the town? Why we should be elected."</b>
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply asks, "Sounds perhaps ye wish to run fir Mayor?"</b>
</p><p>Roelon rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Roelon shrugs.
</p><p>Aliashyrah blinks in puzzlement at Jiarine.
</p><p><b>Jiarine skeptically says, "Of course."</b>
</p><p>Gespry nods slowly.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "I'm quite confident even you understood my main point, Jiarine. It is through community that we stay strong."</b>
</p><p>Geijon smiles.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically asks, "Any other questions for Sorlu?"</b>
</p><p>Gespry surveys the area.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Roelon, Sorlu says, "One step at a time."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Roelon.
</p><p>Gespry nods.
</p><p>Gespry bows to Sorlu.
</p><p>Speaking politely to Gespry, Aliashyrah says, "Please, allow Fropple to speak. I have no pressing matters that may pull me away and do not mind waiting."
</p><p><b>Speaking melodically to Sorlu, Gespry says, "Thanks Sorlu for your time and speech to those here."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Gespry.
</p><p>Speaking melodically to Fropple, Gespry asks, "You prepared? or going to wing it?"
</p><p>Sorlu takes a few steps toward a vine-carved cherrywood cart.
</p><p>Jiarine mouths,"I winged it."
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Jiarine tosses back her head and runs her fingers through her hair.
</p><p>Gespry nods.
</p><p>Fropple says, "I readies."
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Ok then."

</pre>
<p><i>You see Fropple Undertart the Warrior.</i>
</p><p><i>He appears to be a Halfling.</i>
</p><p><i>He is taller than average.  He appears to have come of age.  He has blue eyes and freckled skin.  He has short, curly light brown hair.  He has a plump face, a button nose and bushy sideburns.</i>
</p><p><i>He has a frozen mule tattoo on his arm, a frosted tart tattoo on his neck, and a skull and crossbones tattoo on his wrist.</i>
</p><p><i>He is holding a mug of rum-laced coffee in his left hand.</i>
<i>He is wearing a spiked set of halfling-crafted field plate, a hooded spidersilk cloak, a Warrior Guild Master pin, a spidersilk pack, a dingy gold ring, a spidersilk sack, and a wiregrass anklet.</i>

    It also important to has a strong and tough warrior, someone to remind all that Icemule Trace and halfling make best warrior of all, and defend town from front lines. Leaders lead from front!"<b></b>

    Make tough decisions so long that they are right, even if unpopular
    And when necessary, fight toughs and slice the bad guys to pieces!"<b></b>

<p>In one blurring motion, Fropple snatches a kroderine claidhmore from his harness, brandishing it for all to see.
</p><p>Fropple raises his kroderine claidhmore in triumph!
</p><p>Fropple places his kroderine claidhmore on his foot, then straightens.  With a deft kick, he sends the claidhmore into the air, causing it to arch nicely and land in his weapon harness!

<p><i>You see Aliashyrah.</i>
</p><p><i>She appears to be an Illistim Elf.</i>
</p><p><i>She is average height.  She appears to be youthful.  She has wide-set sea green eyes and alabaster skin.  She has shoulder length, glossy auburn hair.  She has a delicate face, a classical nose and a generous mouth.  She has a pair of eahnor chevrons adorned with some raven's feathers dangling from her ears.</i>
</p><p><i>She is in good shape.</i>
</p><p><i>She is wearing a filigreed eahnor choker dripping auroral emeralds, a silver-chained overgown dripping shards of glossy onyx, a sideless leather gown dyed a metallic hematite black, and some dark ora filament-strapped silk boots lofted on beveled heels.</i>

</p><p><b>Aliashyrah warmly greets, "Blessed evening to all. I am aquainted with some of you, however a greater number of you are unknown to me, much as I am to you. Let me begin by sharing my name. I am Aliashyrah Ilthaerhys."</b>
</p><p>Roelon nods once.
</p><p>Straightening her back, Aliashyrah gives a formal, low curtsy.  She inclines her head as well, giving a brief nod.
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah smoothly continues, "I journeyed to Icemule a short time past in the hopes of investigating and validating the various rumors that had traversed across these lands to the halls of Ta'Illistim, my home. Armed with a mixture of curisotiy and uncertainty, I set off in pursuit of the facts."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods once.
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah says, "Upon arriving I quickly learned that while welcoming, Icemule and her citizens dilligently guard their history and secrets against those they perceive as outsiders. With this unexpected challenge set before me, I chose to not only learn about the recent more monumental events, but to aquaint myself with some of the hisoty and traditions of this fair town and her people."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah smiles quietly to herself.
</p><p>Sorlu nods slowly.
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah pleasantly says, "It was an endeavor which has brought me great joy and led me to this podium in front of all of you."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah gently brushes her auburn hair away from her eyes and, with a deft twist of her wrist, tucks it behind one ear.
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah honestly admits, "I cannot claim to rival some of the other fine candidates with regard to time spent in Icemule."</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah steadily proposes, "Even so, I humbly present for your consideration that I may have something unique to offer, precisely because of the fact that I am a more recent citizen."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu looks thoughtfully at Aliashyrah.

</p><p><b>Aliashyrah diplomatically says, "The recent events in town have highlighted the strength and character of Icemule, but they have also left scattered seeds of discord and mistrust. It is only to be expected when matters of betrayal and possession are involved."</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah says, "As someone who was not present during that tumultuous time, I possess a clean slate and an unbiased view of each citizen."</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah solemnly promises, "Every one of you is equal in my eyes and would be treated as such."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah smiles.
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah says, "I am further blessed with an outside perspective, which means that my decisions will be based solely on the current needs and desires of the town rather than muddied by past events or connections."</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah seriously says, "The position of town councilor is one that demands a great deal of accountability and passion. Each councilor should bring to the table a unique perspective to allow the mayor the advantage of a well-rounded collection of information with which to make his decisions. This will ensure that Icemule does not become an echo chamber for recycled thoughts and actions."</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah honestly attests, "There is still work to be done as the Abbey suffers even now with unwanted and unwelcome occupants, a murderer plaugues the otherwise peaceful streets of town, and new but somewhat tenuous alliances have been formed which will need attention."</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah adds, "There is also a general disconnect that I have noted between the average citizen of town and those who lead. Many who I spoke to upon my arrival were oblivious to town issues and events. This is a travesty and one which I would address by encouraging open discourse and ensuring all pertinent matters are made readily accessible."</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah humbly concludes, "I would ask that you consider me for one of the open council seats. Regardless of your decision during these elections, I will remain here working side by side with each of you to shape the future of Icemule while considering and respecting her past."</b>

</p><p>Teaberry applauds.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically asks, "Any questions for Aliashyrah?"</b>
</p><p>Gespry surveys the area.
</p><p><b>Jiarine asks, "Do I need to raise my hand again?"</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Jiarine, Nodyre says, "No."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "Go ahead Jiarine."</b>
</p><p>Roelon grins slowly.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Jiarine, Aliashyrah teases, "It's good exercise."</b>
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "Fine, fine."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu grins.
</p><p>Roelon grins.
</p><p>Gespry arches a skeptical eyebrow as he takes in his surroundings.
</p><p>Nodyre seems to be waiting for something.
</p><p><b>Jiarine asks, "You seem to be a student of knowledge but what happens if somewhere else in the world there is a bigger story unfolding.  Will you venture there to write its history or remain in a perhaps placid town?"</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah smiles at Jiarine.
</p><p>Teaberry leans forward.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Jiarine, Aliashyrah confirms, "I am indeed a student of knowledge. However, though the pursuit of knowledge is what led me here, I have found that it is somewhere I plan to stay for the forseeable future. I would not have taken the time and effor to become a citizen if my attention could so easily be pulled elsewhere."</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah says, "You will learn in time that I am not of a fickle nature."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu nods.
</p><p><b>Jiarine lightly says, "Except we do not know much about you."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in agreement at Jiarine.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Jiarine, Aliashyrah says, "Indeed. I look forward to getting to know each of you more throughout time and interactions. That will not change whether you choose to put your trust in me as a councilmember or not."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu glances between Gespry and Perigourd.
</p><p>Aliashyrah gazes with interest at Perigourd.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Aliashyrah, Perigourd asks, "In studying the history of Icemule, how would you characterize it, and it's importance?"</b>
</p><p>Perigourd cocks his head at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Perigourd.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "A good question."</b>
</p><p>Fropple rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Cryheart nods at Perigourd.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Perigourd, Aliashyrah says, "The short answer would be that I have found it to be a proud and resilient town."</b>
</p><p>Gespry inclines his ear, listening intently.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Perigourd, Aliashyrah says, "If you would like me to expound further, I can."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p><b>Perigourd says, "I'd be happy to listen, depending upon available time."</b>
</p><p>Perigourd glances inquiringly at Gespry.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "We have a few more minutes."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah smiles.
</p><p>Vaemyr nods at Sorlu.
</p><p>Entwil rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Meaning..."
</p><p>Sorlu gazes with interest at Aliashyrah.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Perigourd, Aliashyrah says, "While some may see the location as a disadvantage, Icemule is uniquely situated to be an important hub for travel. Already many come to journey to the Rift. The Hinterwilds were found through the actions and efforts of this town. There are connections to the south and some to the east."</b>
</p><p>Nodyre squints.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Perigourd, Aliashyrah says, "It has a rich history of overcoming adversity and has proven recently to be just as strong in that regard."</b>
</p><p>Perigourd nods to Aliashyrah.
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah says, "Though I do echo Sorlu that there seems to be a certain lack of organized defense but I see shadows of what used to be a strongly </b>defended city also."<b></b>
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Aliashyrah says, "I hope that answers your question."<b></b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah smiles.
</p><p>Sorlu nods in agreement to Aliashyrah.
</p><p><b>Perigourd says, "Yes, it had one of the most formidable militia's in the west at one point."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Perigourd.
</p><p>Missoni agrees with Perigourd.
</p><p>Nodyre laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.
</p><p>Missoni murmurs, "Long live the Northern Fury."
</p><p>Perigourd begins chuckling at Missoni!
</p><p>Fropple squeals.
</p><p>Gespry nods slowly.
</p><p>Geijon nods.
</p><p>Roelon nods.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically asks, "Any other questions?"</b>
</p><p>Gespry glances at Nodyre.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Gespry, Nodyre says, "Oh, I've heard enough."</b>
</p><p>Gespry nods.
</p><p>Entwil nods in agreement at Nodyre.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Ok."
</p><p><b>Speaking melodically to you, Gespry says, "Thank you Aliashyrah for your speech and willingness to toss your hat into the ring for town council."</b>
</p><p>Fropple applauds.
</p><p>Sorlu applauds Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Roelon agrees with Gespry.
</p><p><b>Gespry recites melodically:</b>
</p>
<pre>   "Thank you all, Speakers, Audience and anyone not covered by the previous two, for today's live speech event.  I'm sure Rammael will let us know when the actual voting will start and end.  Good luck to all who are running, and may everyone choose who they wish to be a part of Icemules Town Council."<b></b>
</pre>
<p>Sorlu smiles.
</p><p>Missoni smiles.
</p><p>Missoni applauds warmly.
</p><p>Sorlu raises his winter rose tea in a toast!
</p><p>Vaemyr nods.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "We look forward to work with ye."
</p><p>Aliashyrah applauds politely.
</p><p>Vaemyr applauds.
</p><p>Roelon applauds.
</p><p>Teaberry applauds.
</p><p>Jiarine says, "For the record I am not a citizen of this town and cannot vote for myself.  I expect you to do that."
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "If you have further questions for any of those still here and present.  free for all away.  after Rammael escapes."</b>
</p><p>Cryheart grins at Jiarine.
</p><p>Speaking to Jiarine, Nodyre says, "Most folks here aren't citizens either."
</p><p>Trouthe applauds.
</p><p>Nodyre chuckles.
</p><p><b>Missoni happily says, "Thank you, everyone. That was very informative."</b>
</p><p>Speaking to Rammael, Vaemyr says, "I hope you feel better."
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah curiously asks, "Are only citizens able to vote?"</b>
</p><p><b>Jiarine says, "They are."</b>
</p><p>Gespry nods to Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Jiarine inquires, "What reason did the other councilers give for not being here?"
</p><p>Speaking to Jiarine, Sorlu says, "They have withdrawn."
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Kobane."
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Jiarine.
</p><p>Sorlu appears to be trying hard not to grin.
</p><p>Speaking to Sorlu, Jiarine says, "Imagine that... you would have another hat to throw into the fire."
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Had to travel, and had no time frame of when he would return, and withdrew from the council."
</p><p>Jiarine says, "Mmm no.  I meant the ones currently sitting."
</p><p>Jiarine says, "I see one here."
</p><p>Jiarine glances at Roelon.
</p><p>Jiarine says, "Or two."
</p><p>Jiarine clears her throat.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Wow."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "There is only one other nae here."
</p><p>Roelon raises an eyebrow in Jiarine's direction.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Opalina."
</p><p>Jiarine says, "The seat is so highly sought that I would think those currently on it would ALL be here."
</p><p>Fropple rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "I can nae speak for her absence currently, thugh I did see her around earlier."
</p><p>Roelon nods slowly.
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Hrmsies, yet they cannot endorse any particular candidate yes, yes?"
</p><p>Rammael walks off into the distance.
</p><p>Cryheart says, "There could be many reasons for someone's absence."
</p><p>Fropple exclaims, "Perhap it best they not come, to not influence!"
</p><p>Fropple rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Fropple nods knowingly.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Dis must be answer."
</p><p>Jiarine soothingly says, "Of course.  Whatever is best."
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Fropple nods reassuringly.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "I came, but it was to see what was said, and by whom."
</p><p>Jiarine teases, "I should guard my tongue then as not to upset anyone before the voting takes place."
</p><p>Cryheart says, "Oh, I was remiss."
</p><p>Roelon grins slowly.
</p><p>Perigourd looks thoughtfully at Sorlu.
</p><p>Roelon nods at Gespry.
</p><p>Sorlu nods slowly.
</p><p>Geijon furrows his brow.
</p><p>Geijon says, "This took an odd turn."
</p><p>Sorlu takes a drink from his winter rose tea.
</p><p>Jiarine drops into a deep curtsy, moving smoothly as her arms sweep grandly to her sides.
</p><p>Speaking to Jiarine, Trouthe asks, "Is that even possible?"
</p><p>Jiarine says, "You think so little of me."
</p><p>Jiarine sniffs.
</p><p>Trouthe grins at Jiarine.
</p><p>Trouthe raises her voice in merry laughter.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "Well, it appears Rammael has run off.  I'm sure he'll annoucne in some way, when and where the voting will begin.  some point in the near future."</b>
</p><p>Entwil quietly says, "This was quite informative, thanks to all candidates for giving their thoughts and ideas."
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Sorlu grins.
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Teaberry nods at Gespry.
</p><p>Missoni nods approvingly.
