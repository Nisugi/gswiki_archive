</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Log">Log</span></h2>
<p>Kaonashi softly says, "Good evening, everyone.  I am GM Kaonashi, the Gemstone IV guru for the town of Kraken's Fall.  I am happy to see you here for this OOC meeting."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Magic won't work here."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I am joined tonight by several members of Gemstone IV's Events Team.  I am pleased to be here with APM Thandiwe, SGM Xynwen, and AGM Optheria.  Their guidance and support have been invaluable over the first months of my tenure as Guru, and I am thrilled they can join us tonight."
</p><p>Yardie gasps, "A Kroderine room."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Sir please."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I aim to keep tonight fairly simple and straightforward.  First, I would like to share with you some of the results of the OOC Meeting survey that was put before the players who are citizens of Kraken's Fall and call it home.  Then, I will discuss some of the more common questions and concerns we received.  Lastly, I will open the meeting up for questions, so you can ask us things that might not have been addressed."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "First, however, I will give a brief update on the town, its public ongoing projects, and a summary of some of the changes that have been made since I took over in the summer of 2024.  If at any point you wish to ask a question, add your name to the list that exists in this room.  We will return to it after my presentation."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Since I assumed my duties as Kraken's Fall Guru for Gemstone IV in the summer of 2024, I am proud to say that we have released several convenience of play features and areas designed to make the town more fun, livable, and comprehensive."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "At Simucon 2024, I announced the release of the Nereid's Cradle, Canopied Walk, otherwise known as the Kraken s Fall Night Market.  This space was designed to serve as a community gathering point.  As part of this, we expanded beach fishing across Nereid's Cradle, opened several new fishing spots on the Canopied Walk itself, and opened a brand new Brawling Pit beneath the Walk's planks.  I am pleased to see that this space has received regular use, and I am thrilled that we can hold both player-run and GM-run events here."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "In the months that followed, we also released a Multihued Pavilion on the same Canopied Walk.  This was built as an event space for meeting some lively friends, sea kobolds, but I also look forward to using it in other fun and varied ways over the coming months and years."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "In the spirit of convenience of play, I have also begun to work on facilities that will bring Kraken's Fall in line with other Elanthian towns and settlements, while expanding the storytelling in town.  An example of this was in the newly-opened Cleric Shop attached to the Peaceful Porpoise.  With this infrastructure in place, players can now more easily enjoy the recently-updated Paladin Service, as well as a few other offerings typically found in such shops."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Examples of this are seen in the Atoll hunting ground, where I worked with staff from Gemstone IV's development team to eliminate bugs related to the log ride toward the Atoll and relating to the way hidden Atoll mobs interact with players and their spells.  I also personally worked with players and staff to address a few OSA-related bugs and errors."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "All the while, I am proud to continue offering core guru services for the town, including monthly citizen GALD and WPS sessions during existing windows.  I also have asked Gentleman Hoorne to continue to spread the gospel of Kraken's Fall, extolling its benefits and virtues across Elanthia.  You might have seen him recently in Wehnimer's Landing, negotiating metal rights with merchants there and with Dwarves who call Teras Isle and Zul Logoth home, and generally being  very brave  in the face of danger."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Now, onto the results of the survey."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "First, some basic data.  13 individuals submitted responses to our survey.  Of these, two thirds listed themselves as citizens of Kraken's Fall, with nearly three-quarters saying they spend the majority of their time on our shores.  But this doesn't fully encapsulate our town population, which is both larger and perhaps not always readily checking Discord."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "As a starting point, I will go over a few of the more common questions and concerns.  I would ask you hold your questions, both citizen and honorary citizen alike, until the end."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We're just getting going, hello."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Our survey asked two primary questions: what are some improvements you would like to see for Kraken's Fall in 2025 and beyond, and what roleplaying options would you like to see for the town.  Please hold your questions until I've gone over the basics here and answered some more common questions.  Then we will be happy to return to any topics you wish to discuss further."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I will now get into a few of the more common questions, with some answers I have discussed with the team."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were asked about the status of Player Shops in Kraken's Fall, and the potential for expansion.  At this time, we have no immediate plans for additional expansion."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were asked about Kraken's Fall potentially being a starting town.  While we welcome new players and characters with hunting grounds for their levels, there are no plans for Kraken's Fall to be a starting town."
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Erienne, "You've not missed much.  He's going over the questions that were asked and the answers."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were asked about the availability of Ranger herbs that are essential for the updated Ranger service.  This is something I will look into."
</p><p>Erienne whispers, "Thank you."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were asked about citizen benefits, including access to specific citizen verbs.  This is absolutely something I am interested in and will be working on.  I do not have a hard timetable, but I would be eager to see further citizen benefits along these lines in 2025."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Arrr."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were asked about professional guild expansion in Kraken's Fall.   I began this project last year, tangentially, with the Cleric Shop expansion.  I will have more to share about what comes next in the coming months, but convenience of play features like this that bring Kraken's Fall more in line with existing Elanthian towns are high on my to-do list."
</p>
<pre>Kaonashi softly says, "So, stay tuned."
</pre>
<p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were asked about ongoing issues that players either see as bugs or annoyances, like the flood of warden arrows in the Atoll.  As someone with extensive Atoll hunting experience, let me be clear: I hear this concern, and it's valid.  I will be looking into this in the coming months."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "With that being said, I want to be open and transparent about fixes to the town: if something isn't working, please always feel free to BUG it or send an ASSIST so it can be considered and addressed in a timely manner if necessary."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Especially if something is broken to such a degree as to hamper daily play."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were asked about minor roleplaying features that people would like to see expanded, including town ambients.  We were also asked about mechanical bonuses for spells like 1205 which may or may not be working as intended here in Kraken's Fall.  I will look into these issues with an eye to fix anything that might not be working properly and to expand the flair that makes Kraken's Fall special."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were asked about expansion of the Atoll Hunting Ground, particularly for players pushing higher bounds of ascension.  There are no plans to expand the Atoll or to create new hunting grounds in Kraken's Fall.  But, as was announced at Simucon 2024, new ascension hunting grounds that compliment Kraken's Fall's flavor are in the works, named Sailor's Grief."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Stay tuned.  Because I think you'll find that quite exciting."
</p><p>Yardie exclaims, "Let's go!!!!"
</p><p>Erienne says, "Ooh."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "That does sound promising."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Yes yes, let's."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were asked about the potential for new town shrines to fill out our religious offerings.  All I can say about this is: stay tuned, because this is something I view as important to our town identity."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Trallihn, Khoal asks, "Was dat you?"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were asked about a multitude of low-stakes roleplaying events and opportunities, from building sandcastles to increased town ambients, from random flotsam washing ashore to getting to know local bandits better, and from more interactivity with the sea to quote a tsunami unquote.  While we have no plans to wash away Kraken's Fall in a massive wave  yet   I agree that low-stakes roleplaying and smaller events are in the spirit of Kraken's Fall.  Like with the sea kobold night market event from last autumn, I look forward to curating smaller events throughout 2025 and beyond  starting right here after Duskruin.  Again, stay tuned."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Yet."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "I, for one, welcome our new tsunami overlords."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Something something toiling in their water caves?"
</p><p>Speaking to Trallihn, Dendum says, "Free baths for everyone."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I do not support disaster, but... noted."
</p><p>Yardie exclaims, "Sailing into the Grief near home....so happy!  Wooo!!"
</p><p>Erienne says, "Chaos is fun though."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "I'm waterproof, like those ducks on Dawn commercials."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were asked about Kraken's Fall's participation in broader Elanthian storylines.    Several of you indicated that you'd prefer for Kraken's Fall to remain more isolated from these storylines.  As I've said, my intention is to focus principally on smaller-stakes roleplaying opportunities and one-off events on our shores.  But I also cannot rule out a broader storyline touching home here in some manner.  Your preferences are noted, however."
</p><p>Erienne says, "And since your name sounds like it starts the same way..."
</p><p>Speaking to Trallihn, you say, "Yes, water is actually afraid of you."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Yardie exclaims, "Don't you bring that juju to the Folly, Ricky Bobby!"
</p><p>Speaking to Trallihn, Dendum asks, "Do I have your permission to add that to your wiki page?"
</p><p>Pangin raspily asks, "Non pumpkin invasion?"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We were also asked a few questions that do not relate specifically to Kraken's Fall.  While I will not speak to these questions directly here, I would urge you to look to Discord and other forums to discuss any issues that might be concerning you."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "And, as always, feel free to ASSIST if you need immediate help."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "These are answers to some of the more common questions we saw in our survey results.  Thank you for your patience as I worked through them."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I would now invite you to please ask other questions you might have of us.  Please keep in mind that we are here to discuss Kraken's Fall specifically, and I'd ask you to keep your questions related to the town, its features, and plans for 2025 and beyond."
</p><p>Speaking to Leff, Yardie exclaims, "Sailor's Grief!  Woooo!!"
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Tabubu, Khoal says, "We shoulds asked to have our own private pier built for the ship."
</p><p>Yardie says, "I'm not signing that.  I'm not getting teleported, but I do have a question."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Khoal, Tabubu says, "I like that idea."
</p><p>You ask, "You get teleported if you sign it?"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Yardie says, "Something was happening.  I taken no risks."
</p><p>Omrii says, "I only signed to enjoy the ride to Illi."
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "With a Yardie shack on it."
</p><p>Optheria says, "Out and right back."
</p><p>Speaking to Yardie, Dendum says, "Its fixed."
</p><p>You say, "Huh."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We will start with Leff, who is first on the sign-up list."
</p><p>Yardie asks, "See?!?"
</p><p>Leff says, "While I don't pretend to speak for everyone, I do feel comfortable in saying for *almost* everyone, that was a thoughtful and detailed summary. Thank you. And, I feel comfortable saying, thank you for all your work over the last year to make this place continue to be special."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Just like that."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "It's for the best."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I appreciate you saying that.  Thank you."
</p><p>Leff says, "Seriously, I appreciate the preparation that went into it on the front end."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Here here."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "You all are worthy of only my best.  I was hired to give it, and give it I shall."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Something something Ghezresh."
</p><p>Leff says, "My first question, is about justice."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Do you have any specific questions that were not addressed to your satisfaction?"
</p><p>Leff says, "Can we please have a conversation about its role on this island, what it is for, and whether it is a good fit for this community."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Here here."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "What he's trying to say."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Is the constable is worthless."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Can you be more specific about what you feel is not working to your satisfaction?"
</p><p>Leff says, "Yes, I think it is antithetical to the vibe here. I think the town should be a no justice town. At least at night."
</p><p>Leff says, "And I say that purely from a roleplaying standpoint."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Ooooh."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Nice."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Once the cat is asleep, the mice will... eat?"
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Pirates."
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "I for one ... prefere the constable being worthless..."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Hard to be a pirate with the law dog on us."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Even though the constable is an alcohilic, which fits."
</p><p>Leff asks, "I have many thoughts on justice and the system, and I don't want to make this broader. But purely OOC for KF.... can we turn it off at night so we can pickpocket in town? Can the nightmarket have pickpocketing? Why do we have it here at all?"
</p><p>Speaking to Yardie, Dendum says, "Sounds like we can shank you after this little shindig."
</p><p>Leff says, "Thank you for considering."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Thank you for the question.  One moment please while I compose a response."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "No going to the google copilot for it."
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "Cant steal here either."
</p><p>Pangin raspily asks, "Took you this long to try?"
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "Once Leff brought it up.. i was like.. lemme try."
</p><p>Omrii says, "At least I'm prepared if I come live here."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Justice is a core town mechanic.  That itself will not go away.  It's at the heart of each major Elanthian settlement.  That being said, I hear your issue with wanting to encourage roguish roleplaying.  I will put my head to this and consider if there are any situations where we might find fun given that basic fact.  I will add it to my list to consider, but can make no promises."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Shouldn't the bandits be pirates round here."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Are there other questions you might have, Leff?"
</p><p>Leff says, "I'll sign back up on the list. I don't want to hog the spotlight."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Much obliged."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Leff, Khoal says, "Ask about a private pier for my ship."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Omrii, how may we address your concerns tonight?"
</p><p>Omrii amusedly says, "I signed the list cause I was told to, probably says something about me personally.  I do not have questions."
</p><p>Speaking raspily to Omrii, Pangin says, "Same same."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "It is good to see you regardless.  You have just transitioned from Plat, correct?"
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Me too."
</p><p>Omrii says, "Yes, my nickname is now Station apparently."
</p><p>Leifa says, "Yay, more dwarves to tease."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Here here, welcome aboard."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We will have others like Omrii here, who are new to our Prime Kraken's Fall community.  I want to say this to them: WELCOME.  You are valued, and I look forward to joining you in making this community as vibrant as can be."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Welcome."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Dendum is next."
</p><p>Dendum says, "Thank you for allowing me to address such excellent company directly."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Dendum, Khoal says, "Dont get nervous."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Thank you for joining us."
</p><p>Dendum says, "But much like the Bills on a fourth quarter on a fourth down I am at a loss, I only signed because leff said NOT to."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "And like that, the Chiefs are in the Superb Owl."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Dendum, Khoal says, "Ask about a private pier for my ship."
</p><p>Leifa says, "Ugh, don't hurt us with that reference."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "If you change you mind, please just let me know."
</p><p>Dendum says, "I did like that starter town idea."
</p><p>Leifa says, "Dendum really just wants his official honorary papers from Tabubu."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "A starter town, aye.  A fascinating thought, but not one we'll be able to entertain.  That being said, pirates and rogues come in all shapes, sizes, and levels."
</p><p>Speaking to Dendum, Yardie says, "Yo I'm going to hurt you."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "If one wants to make their way here, we'll be able to support them from the start."
</p><p>Speaking to Yardie, Dendum says, "Not with this justice system."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "So, tell your friends: Kraken's Fall is a new "IT" town."
</p><p>You say, "There is the ferry, you could always *cough* *cough* kidnap young ones."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Dendum, Tabubu says, "We think we found a loop hole, something about an angry giant in a bear costume."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "This is where I'd make a Pennywise joke, but instead I'll move along."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Nickonai, how may we address your concerns tonight?"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Yardie asks, "Kidnapping...younglings?"
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Who are we kidnapping?"
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Again."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Yardie jokes, "Oh that's those folks up north by Swolehaven."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Shh."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "I too signed up just as record. With that said, my only thing was it would be nice of the Temple area was bigger. But you already addressed that."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Erienne, Tabubu says, "I think they like when we do that."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Yes."
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "This is like trying to herd cats."
</p><p>Speaking to Khoal, Trallihn says, "Brooms and spraybottles."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "It gets very crowded at times."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Kraken's Fall is a ragtag community.  That comes with individuals of multiple religious disciplines."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We can't all pick the correct religion, pick Ghezresh."
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "Sooo.. about that private pier fer me ship."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "I would love some of those for the eyes of arkati too."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "That being said, stay tuned.  Seriously.  I think 2025 will hold many fun surprises for you."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Does that sufficiently answer your question?"
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Erienne, Khoal says, "Pirate Kings never signs up on no list."
</p><p>Pangin raspily asks, "Me?"
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Sure."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Poor Khoal."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Thanks for what you have been doing."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Nooo."
</p><p>Erienne exclaims, "We're suppose to sail tonight!"
</p><p>Khoal heartily exclaims, "Me ship neva be sunk!"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Pangin, you will be next."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "How may I address any concerns you may have."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "I have none really. Just more ale more tarts."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Appreciate you."
</p><p>Omrii says, "Woohoo, more ale, I'm useful."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Apologies for the confusion.  Did you have a question, Pangin?"
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Oh, sorry."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Nope."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Thanks."
</p><p>Pangin raspily says, "Thanks."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Thank you for coming, all the same."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Yardie is next on the list."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "How may I help, sir?"
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Must be a good one."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Good question.  Sorry, no.  The mice aren't going away."
</p><p>Keruta says, "Here we go."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Yardie, Khoal says, "Make up fer the rest of the scallywags failin to have questions after signing up."
</p><p>You say, "Heh."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "No locks on the brown sugar either."
</p><p>Yardie says, "I'll keep it brief.  The first one is about the Brawling Pit and the position there.  I'm happy that it's a brawl joint, curiously wished for the arena like the flotilla.  What's the word on the position and whatnot?  And the other question is regarding the Festival of Rememberence and Reconcilition."
</p><p>Yardie asks, "That's supposed to be in Fash....Fash....Fash on toes or whatever it is.  What's the word?"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "There will not be a formal position related to it.  But, in the spirit of increased RP and access, I will begin rolling out multiple opportunities for access each month.  It will be for everyone."
</p><p>You say, "Fashanos."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Fashionus."
</p><p>Leifa says, "Woo, hoo, Monday Night Fights IS happening?  Maybe."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I hear your desire for more formalized, casual RP sessions."
</p><p>Leff says, "I hate saying respectfully, because then it doesn't come off that way."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I will begin planning as such."
</p><p>Leff asks, "But respectfully, and I really mean it, could you consider opening it up entirely?"
</p><p>Yardie says, "It seemed like a cool holiday."
</p><p>Leff says, "It's a neat mechanic, and it's a bummer to have it gated."
</p><p>Yardie says, "So I'm chuffed for it."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I appreciate your patience.  This is very much at the forefront of my mind."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "As I think all that happens at the Canopied Walk, from the awful food, cheap drink, and fights, are central to the fun we can informally have together."
</p><p>Leff says, "If anything, it would be neat to have the current brawling pit iteration open all the time, and a second fighting pit open for events (e.g. like the flotilla FOTF arena)."
</p><p>Yardie exclaims, "We'll behave!  We promise!"
</p><p>Leff says, "There's justice to make sure."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Behave?  Us?"
</p><p>Yardie says, "Besides, better to have a safe space to let out pent up frustrations."
</p><p>Omrii skeptically says, "Bold last words."
</p><p>Leifa asks, "Can't the gates unclink for a few hours on select nights, though?"
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Maybe some of us had our fingers crossed?"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Your concerns are noted.  I will take them under advisement."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Did you have further questions, Yardie?"
</p><p>Yardie says, "Ummmm."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Yardie, Khoal says, "Private pier."
</p><p>Yardie says, "I have already asked about the bungalows as well...and waiting on that.  Let the others ask stuff."
</p><p>Yardie says, "Don't want to bother."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I will move along then."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Thank you for joining us tonight."
</p><p>You say, "The Bungalow release is just waiting for a time to raffle it.  Now that the raffle system works for citizenship we've got less barriers."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Oooo."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Hear that, friends?"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Yardie exclaims, "Now!  Do eeeet naaaaow!"
</p><p>Trallihn says, "Hmmm... that's my question answered."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "So, stay tuned."
</p><p>Speaking to Yardie, you exclaim, "Don't pressure me!"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Yardie exclaims, "But....pressure equals diamonds!"
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Beach shacks for the locals with papers."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Well, given that, do you have any *other* questions, Trallihn?"
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Tabubu, Khoal says, "Like official citizens like yaself."
</p><p>Speaking to Kaonashi, Trallihn says, "Hmmm... let's see... what's the odds of another bar being opened on the Island? I think we should have more bars than all the other towns...."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "More booze per capita?"
</p><p>You amusedly ask, "Don't you already?"
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "Can never have to many bars."
</p><p>Littlemelody asks, "Something bright picked out of the sky?"
</p><p>Khoal heartily exclaims, "Hear hear!"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Noted.  I will take it under advisement."
</p><p>Keruta exclaims, "Bar hopping!"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Trallihn, needs, booze."
</p><p>Omrii says, "I'll move here tomorrow for a bar crawl."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Trallihn says, "Well... yeah, but we want to make sure we stay ahead! Plus pirates are always being thrown out."
</p><p>Erienne says, "We do have a lot of bars."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I love them all."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We have many bars.  But that doesn't mean we can't eventually have more."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Noted."
</p><p>Keruta asks, "Is there a bar in the Logging Colony?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "Yes."
</p><p>You say, "Yes, yes, there is."
</p><p>Speaking to Keruta, Leff says, "The last Frontier."
</p><p>Leff says, "It's the best one."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "A bar in the Atoll, you say?"
</p><p>Leff says, "Mounts everywhere."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "The Thirsty Triton?"
</p><p>Nisugi says, "There's not a bar in Black Weald."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Perhaps in one of the grottos."
</p><p>Speaking to Kaonashi, Trallihn exclaims, "The Tipsy Triton!"
</p><p>Omrii says, "A bar in the Atoll you can only reach by being swept away in the tide."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Any further questions, sir?"
</p><p>Keruta exclaims, "What about Widowmaker's Road?!"
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Somewhere to hide from the wave."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Good idea."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I'd never get to go in."
</p><p>Leff says, "The booze will take a real atoll on you."
</p><p>Speaking to Kaonashi, Trallihn asks, "How about partial citizenship? Any thought given there?"
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Tabubu, Khoal says, "Nobody hides from the wave."
</p><p>Speaking to Kaonashi, Trallihn says, "Wouldn't be the first town to offer it."
</p><p>You ask, "Can't anyone get partial citizenship?"
</p><p>You ask, "Really?"
</p><p>You say, "Hmm."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Most towns don't have partial citizenship."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to you, Tabubu says, "I have it, if you want to see my papers."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "It's only for those towns that don't allow full citizenship for all races."
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "I know them elfy towns do partial."
</p><p>Yardie says, "I'd be down for Tabubu having an honorary partial citizenship, just on the basis of her creativity."
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "Cause... elfs."
</p><p>Speaking to Xynwen, Trallihn says, "But a pirate town... would kind of make sense. Especially for folks who may be tethered to FWI due to something like a shop."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I wonder if partial citizenship should be considered for anyone who is a Mist Harbor citizen."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "There's no need for partial citizenship here."
</p><p>Leff says, "Of course, OOC, the only reason many folks dont have citizenship here is because of player shop restrictions."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "So they can get citizen GALD in another town if they're partial citizens?"
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Partial citizenship, isn't that kind of like..."
</p><p>You say, "Maybe thats what I'm thinking of.  Because the town allows anyone to be a citizen."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "You aren't a full citizen in one and a partial in another."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "All of the above said."
</p><p>Leff says, "So not having player shops here really does a number on that."
</p><p>Omrii says, "I can't sell anything in a shop anyway, everything is now stuck to me."
</p><p>You say, "The player shop issue really is out of our hands.  There's a lot being worked on with it and we can't even begin to consider it until that work is resolved.  Its burned out a few GMs, so I don't want to add any anxiety or stress to the one working on it."
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "I have no problem being a citizen of the great island... i mean.. if its truely your home.. should not be a problem."
</p><p>Leff says, "I understand. I didn't mean to pressure. What I meant to suggest is, I wonder if there's a way for folks to be partial/honorary/real citizens of KF."
</p><p>Yardie repeats, "I'd be down for Tabubu having an honorary partial citizenship, just on the basis of her creativity."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "There is not a mechanic for an honorary citizenship."
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "Tabubu already is a citizen."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I mean, a piece of paper can say whatever it says."
</p><p>Erienne says, "She's a citizen at heart for sure."
</p><p>Nisugi asks, "Have you seen her papers?"
</p><p>You ask, "She has papers, do you want to see them?"
</p><p>Khoal heartily exclaims, "She gots da papers!"
</p><p>Omrii asks, "A show dog?"
</p><p>Leifa asks, "Who hasn't seen her papers?"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "This specifically relates to services that Gentleman Hoorne might offer that even those papers might not overcome, yes?"
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Citizen services are going to be restricted to the citizenship mechanical."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Tabubu, Khoal says, "Im not gonna lie.. im starting to smell some kind of trap or set up..."
</p><p>Leff says, "And bungalow access, conceivably. Those are the practical implications."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Mostly, Mist Harbor does not have the citizen merchants."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I appreciate the RP of honorary citizenship, and love the enthusiasm.  Hoorne's sessions, however, yes, will be as Xynwen says."
</p><p>Leff says, "Since there is no trading citizen benefit."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "And bungalow beach bum access."
</p><p>Leff says, "All bums are welcome."
</p><p>Leff says, "Oh man. I didn't  mean to say that."
</p><p>Leff says, "But that was funny."
</p><p>Leff says, "Nude beach."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I will look into that as part of the mechanic concerns we discussed in my prepared presentation, but can't make any promises."
</p><p>Leff says, "Anyway."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Please no."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I don't want to see that from my kitchen window."
</p><p>Leff says, "Leave justice on."
</p><p>Speaking to Leff, Edskar says, "Hey, this is a family game."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Erienne, Khoal says, "Yeahs ya do."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Heard."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Doesn't mean I won't keep up the RP."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Don't want you to forget."
</p><p>Speaking to Edskar, Erienne says, "Surrrrre it is."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "This kind of segwayed between Tabubu and Trallihn, given the concern was about citizenship.  Tabubu, you were next on the list.  Aside from this citizenship question, are there other issues you wish to discuss?"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Gesundheit."
</p><p>Erienne says, "You made her melt."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Of course, I have my own."
</p><p>Speaking to Edskar, Leifa says, "Oh hi."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Then please, the floor is yours."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "I am hoping we can adopt a Kraken off our shore line."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Tabubu, Khoal says, "And ONLY the floor."
</p><p>Speaking to Leifa, Edskar says, "Hello."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Adopt a kraken, she says?"
</p><p>Speaking to Tabubu, Yardie says, "That's the one in Sailor's Grief."
</p><p>Yardie says, "It's ooooours."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Noted."
</p><p>Speaking to Tabubu, Edskar says, "Forgive me."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Something that reaches out and eats a tourist here and there."
</p><p>Khoal heartily exclaims, "Hear hear!"
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Someone else had a wyrm, we need a kraken."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Edskar, Tabubu says, "Get it out of your system now."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "While I cannot promise to devour anyone... actually, hmmmm."
</p><p>Omrii asks, "I volunteer as tribute?"
</p><p>Erienne asks, "They could spit them back up?"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "I respect the RP desire I am hearing, to have more kraken-related things?"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Sweet.  Noted."
</p><p>Leifa says, "All the krackalacken good stuff."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Kaonashi, Tabubu says, "The official signet of Kraken's Falls."
</p><p>You say, "Poor Rosario will die of his heart stopping."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "A kraken ranger companion."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Noted, though.  I will consider how we can use low-key RP to enhance the town's native qualities and theme."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Did you have further quesitons, or may I move on?"
</p><p>Speaking to Tabubu, Leff says, "Also, you need one."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Leff says, "It's wonderful."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Without objection, Trackesh is next?"
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Leff, Tabubu says, "Oh I like that, its for the citizens."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "I am done."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Welcome."
</p><p>Trackesh melodically exclaims, "Tanks ya!"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Thank you for cioiming."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Coming, even."
</p><p>Leff says, "Wait."
</p><p>Speaking to Omrii, Edskar asks, "Good stuff?"
</p><p>Leff says, "Follow-up questions, sir, if you don't mind, if we're finishing up."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Oh we weren't done.  I was merely thanking Trackesh for coming."
</p><p>Trackesh melodically asks, "I speak on behest of me Captain... cause as stated before.. Pirate Kings do not sign up on any lists... but... the question be... how can we get the Floatilla back home to Kraken waters were she can be appreciated and loved?"
</p><p>Speaking to Edskar, Omrii says, "Chewy, but I have to put it in the mail."
</p><p>You ask, "Is she stuck again?"
</p><p>Speaking to Trackesh, Leifa exclaims, "Yes, because Khoal needs to take me there!  I've never seen the flotilla!"
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Oh sorry."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Your question is about the Flotilla, yes?"
</p><p>Trackesh melodically says, "Its not here.. its never  been here... it needs to be here."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Isn't it stuck back over by ta'vaalor again?"
</p><p>You say, "Just wait until the southern sea opens....  then it will move MORE."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Sorry, but the flotilla is not a KF-specific situation, so she's not always going to be in KF waters."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Thank you Xynwen."
</p><p>Leff says, "We know. But it's never been here."
</p><p>Trackesh melodically says, "Its never been in kraken waters."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Yes, it has."
</p><p>Erienne says, "It was close a few times."
</p><p>Leff asks, "When released?"
</p><p>Xynwen says, "I've personally made sure it was over here multiple times last year."
</p><p>Speaking to Xynwen, Leff says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Leff asks, "Would you consider making it port accessible?"
</p><p>You say, "That isn't really in the nature or spirit of the flotilla."
</p><p>Trackesh melodically says, "I have never... ever seen it in our waters."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Yeah, it's really not why it was designed."
</p><p>Speaking to Trackesh, Erienne says, "I've seen it around here twice myself."
</p><p>Trackesh melodically says, "Best to be ignored and unused that preciated and loved."
</p><p>Yardie whispers aloud, "If that's the case, then...areeeeena in the Foolllyyyyy."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "What we were looking at is some additional coding to make sure it comes about here more frequently."
</p><p>You ask, "Don't the boards and NPC gossip state where it is?"
</p><p>Xynwen says, "But the person looking at it for me got hung up on other things."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Trackesh, Kaonashi asks, "Given Xynwen's response, does that address your question?"
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Is it the portmaster or handler that you can ask and it tells you which sea it's in?"
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Floatilla go kraken."
</p><p>Speaking melodically to Kaonashi, Trackesh says, "Nope.. buts i understand the situation."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "I'm sorry, I thought I answered the question, let me scroll up."
</p><p>You ask, "I forget which one... maybe the portmaster?"
</p><p>Littlemelody says, "Each person is loved and appreciated wherever they go."
</p><p>Xynwen asks, "Did I miss something besides:  how can we get the Floatilla back home to Kraken waters were she can be appreciated and loved?"
</p><p>You ask, "Who has the weather?"
</p><p>Keruta says, "Dock handler."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "It sounds as if, while the question was answered, the desire is that it appear more regularly in KF waters?"
</p><p>You say, "Then that's the one that I think has the info."
</p><p>Erienne says, "It's the handler."
</p><p>Speaking melodically to Kaonashi, Trackesh says, "Thats it."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I can probably send Hoorne to ask, but... maybe he'll end up fish food for doing so."
</p><p>Trackesh melodically says, "I mean yay.. it was close to hear for 20 min a year or so ago.. but its been collecting dust up by vaalor since."
</p><p>You say, "As Xynwen said, she personally moved it closer multiple times last year."
</p><p>Yardie teases, "Dastardly Vaalorians trying to steal a navy."
</p><p>Trackesh melodically says, "My mistake."
</p><p>Trackesh melodically says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Trackesh melodically exclaims, "Was da best of times!"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "We are grateful you are here.  Thank you for your question and for taking the time to join us."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Moving on, without objection?  Edskar is next on the list."
</p><p>Edskar says, "Thanks. I am new to town, so forgive me a silly question."
</p><p>Speaking to Edskar, Leff exclaims, "Welcome!"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "There are no silly questions."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Only silly people."
</p><p>Edskar asks, "I was wondering if there's a tattoo shop?"
</p><p>Edskar says, "I saw one in the Landing but I don't think that's the place for me."
</p><p>You say, "You know, I don't think there is...."
</p><p>Leff says, "That's a great question."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Excellent question."
</p><p>Leff says, "Sailor tattoos."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "If I may."
</p><p>Edskar asks, "Seems like this should be the place?"
</p><p>Edskar says, "Or a place, anyway."
</p><p>You say, "There's the Inky Den, but that's more a play on Kraken Ink and is the Town Hall... hmm."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I am very interested in tattoos as a Gemstone mechanic.  This is something I will consider and look into over the coming months, be it permanent infrastructure or something more short-term."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "You can seek a monk out."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Edskar exclaims, "I went there thinking I'd get myself some ink!"
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Thanks for the stupid question."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Edskar, Tabubu says, "Your in luck, one lives on the island."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Wasn't stupid after all."
</p><p>Edskar exclaims, "Miracles abound!"
</p><p>You say, "I'll bring a merchant around."
</p><p>You say, "Siduinne tattoos."
</p><p>You say, "Look for her."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Heck yeah."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Thank you for your question.  Great question."
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "Im  outa fireworks."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Nice."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Erienne is next."
</p><p>Optheria says, "Mist Harbor also has Dragonfly Inks, which is a permanent tattoo parlor."
</p><p>You say, "Oh, I forgot about that place....."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "There you go."
</p><p>Speaking to Optheria, Edskar says, "Ah! Now that place is a bit more my speed."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "I don't believe there is a clothing shop on the island?  Will there be, and if so, will it have the customizations like other towns?"
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "If you can get there."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Island attire for tourists would be quite lovely."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Island wear."
</p><p>Edskar says, "I know the secret ways..."
</p><p>You say, "There are several clothing shops."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Leifa, Khoal asks, "Got any fireworks?"
</p><p>You say, "One moment, I have the list..."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "There are?"
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "They have some decent island garb."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I just find all the bars, maybe that's why I can't find the clothes."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Get to drunk and stop looking."
</p><p>You say, "The Threadbare Admiral, Sailcloth Findings."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Oh."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Does it have customizations too?"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Take a peek.  If their likings don't suit you, find something and bring it to Hoorne."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply asks, "Isn't that one for sails?"
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Why did I think that was for ship stuff?"
</p><p>You say, "There isn't a customization NPC, but there are clothing shops."
</p><p>Speaking to Khoal, Leifa says, "I have a yew tube."
</p><p><br/>
Erienne asks, "Are there any plans to add a clothing customization npc?"
</p><p>You say, "Hmm, let me check."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "If not, could there be?"
</p><p>You say, "One second."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Leifa, Khoal says, "Sounds sketchy."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Those tubes are able to be customized, by the way."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "There is not."
</p><p>Leff says, "A two-parter, first part is probably for Thandiwe."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Yardie exclaims, "Aneelos looooore!"
</p><p>You say, "'Yea, there isn't, but there's a lot of tricornes."
</p><p>Keruta asks, "And has any further thought been given to a Confluence instance?"
</p><p>Speaking sheepishly to Yardie, you say, "I know."
</p><p>Edskar says, "Throw in another vote for a customizer."
</p><p>Edskar says, "I like 'em."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Sailcloth findings is clothing. as is Sea's crossing."
</p><p>Speaking to Erienne, you say, "Cultured Corsair has a customizer."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "Does it work for clothing items?"
</p><p>Speaking softly to Keruta, Kaonashi says, "I will look into this and get back to you."
</p><p>You say, "A bandolier-clad elderly human pirate says, "I work on cloth, wood, glass, metal, leather, stone, bone, and gemstone items.  Please TELL me what material we are working with so I may provide you with the correct attachment listing."."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Oh neat."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Erienne, Khoal says, "Boom."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Erienne says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Leff said he had a final question or two, without objection?"
</p><p>Leff asks, "(1) I know it's (several?) years out, but any headway on the KF festival? Can there be a process for inclusion in developing and making it (perhaps a smaller KF focused storyline)? It's something that I imagine you could get a lot of player love and support to help with; (2) and I heard FOTF was great, but the concern I heard from many players was ability to get there. I am really concerned about that for KF, and for events in general. Is there any way you would consider some sort of fast travel access to KF for events? Maybe even the Night Market?"
</p><p>Edskar says, "Pardon."
</p><p>Speaking melodically to Edskar, Trackesh says, "Rude."
</p><p>Leff says, "Thank you for answering all our questions tonight."
</p><p>You say, "We can't provide any details on the festival.  I could be hit by a bus by then and I don't want other people to have to try to remember what I said one day in February three years prior."
</p><p>You say, "Honestly."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Erienne says, "I hope you don't get hit by a bus by then."
</p><p>Erienne says, "You never know tho."
</p><p>Leifa says, "Noone wants that  no."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Crazy drivers."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Beer truck."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Not bus."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Ooh."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I'd rather be hit by a beer truck."
</p><p>You ask, "Leff, doesn't the Ferry get you here fast?"
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Erienne, Khoal says, "Drive fast.. take chances is what i always say."
</p><p>Erienne says, "You can charter a ship that takes 10 minutes."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply asks, "10 minutes?"
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "Use it all the time."
</p><p>Speaking to Khoal, Erienne says, "Me too."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "25k."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "It's a nice feature, yes."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I hate when people say drive safe."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I highly endorse it."
</p><p>Erienne says, "I will not, thank you very much."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Erienne, Khoal says, "Responsibility is fer da birds."
</p><p>Leff says, "For a silver festival, no, I would say 10 minutes isn't fast enough to drive travel across the realms."
</p><p>Leff says, "Honestly. I think the ferry system is perfectly servicable for most things otherwise."
</p><p>You say, "Let me reread your question, I may not be understanding it correctly.  One moment."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Our Night Markets are the best."
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "The system is fine... but.. what we dont have... is a flotilla."
</p><p>Omrii says, "I only want portals back so this is useful."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply says, "I alway lean against the captain and they always lean softly back at me."
</p><p>Speaking to Omrii, Leifa says, "Aww that's a cute little buddy you got there."
</p><p>Leff says, "I think my comment is specifically intended to suggest that for special events, a way to fast travel, would help drive up engagement."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I understand."
</p><p>You say, "Okay, I did understand the question.  So part of having this rotating festival thing is because we WANT people to explore Elanthia and to visit other areas and towns.  You can use the Chronomage to get back and forth."
</p><p>Speaking to Omrii, Edskar says, "Beautiful eyes."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Leff, Khoal says, "Ahh.. im picking up what ya putting down now."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Leff, Khoal says, "Ya want a quick transfer of the flotilla to our waters."
</p><p>You say, "There's multiple options:  The ferry, Chronomage, Mount Travel, Sorcery with fancy chalk..."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Premium halls."
</p><p>You say, "I meant sorcerer."
</p><p>Leff says, "I mean, I'd sponsor a 1minute charter for the night market to get people from the towns here, if there was a way to pay for it."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "A special portal."
</p><p>Leff says, "I hear the response. Thank you for considering."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I think the existing travel features are reasonable given the nature and size of festivals like the one we will have here some day."
</p><p>You say, "Unfortunately, Cross-realm Travel ends up coming out of the hands of the Events/World team and straight into Development and there are restrictions in place for ar season."
</p><p>You say, "We have to follow those guidelines, though I do understand your desire."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Did you have further questions, Leff?"
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Leff, Khoal says, "Ask bouts the flotilla."
</p><p>Leff says, "You hit the rest."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Thank you for your diligence and thorough consideration."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Are there any other questions for good of the order, as we wrap up?"
</p><p>Khoal heartily exclaims, "We done!"
</p><p>Khoal heartily says, "Please."
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "I hear the sea calling us."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Too much time on land for Khoal."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Did you have anything else Erienne?"
</p><p>Erienne says, "Oh."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I see you at the bottom of the list."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Apologies."
</p><p>Erienne says, "We actually got together as a group and submitted all of our questions beforehand."
</p><p>Littlemelody says, "Thank you for letting us all talk, the feedback is really good."
</p><p>Erienne says, "There wasn't much left."
</p><p>You say, "Before you all go..."
</p><p>Raincail raspily says, "Not a question, but just want to touch on the citizen thing from my perspective. Would really love a partial kind of thing. Rain is a rivers rest citizen and that will never change for all the rp reasons. but KF is pretty much his home now. So, yeah. options maybe."
</p><p>Edskar says, "I hope to see all of you around town."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I appreciate the thorough involvement there.  It really allowed me to give a great think to what you might be looking for from Kraken's Fall in 2025 and beyond."
</p><p>Speaking deeply to you, Nickonai asks, "Free orbs?"
</p><p>You say, "Please feel free to add to this if I missed anything...  <a class="external free" href="/wiki/2025-02-03 - Kraken%27s Fall - OOC Meeting (summary).html" rel="nofollow">https://gswiki.play.net/2025-02-03_-_Kraken%27s_Fall_-_OOC_Meeting_(summary)</a>"
</p><p>Erienne says, "Oh yay."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Erienne says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Oh, thank you so much for that."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly asks, "Isn't she the best?"
</p><p>Tabubu quietly says, "Don't forget the keg."
</p><p>Nickonai deeply exclaims, "Ok, thanks for the memories!"
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "In conclusion, let me simply say this: it is a privilege to tell stories for Gemstone IV and for the town of Kraken's Fall.  I am hopeful that, together, we can continue to have a blast telling stories, holding events, and enjoying this world we all love and share."
</p><p>Omrii amusedly says, "I will never forget my keg, unless tricked into being teleported to the other side of Elathnia."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Thank you for joining us tonight at this OOC meeting.  I am grateful to have seen you."
</p><p>Leifa says, "We really appreciate you, Kaonashi."
</p><p>Raincail raspily says, "Cheers to that."
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Omrii, Khoal says, "I tried to steal your keg."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Never hesitate to ask questions of me if you have them."
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Erienne, "Its okay.   I'm really glad to hear that."
</p><p>Speaking to Omrii, Leff says, "Let us know how we can convince you this is your home now."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "I am almost always around."
</p><p>Yardie exclaims, "Really awesome!"
</p><p>Speaking heartily to Kaonashi, Khoal says, "About that flotilla."
</p><p>Speaking to Omrii, Edskar says, "Thanks for the brews."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Thank you all for coming.  You may take the PORTAL back to Kraken's Fall when you are ready to leave."
</p><p>Trallihn says, "Thanks for holding the meeting and hearing us out."
</p><p>Speaking to Leff, Omrii says, "Once my identity crisis on going from three dwarves to two is over, I expect I'll be here."
</p><p>Khoal heartily exclaims, "Thank you!"
</p><p>Speaking to Tabubu, Dendum says, "I am going outside and talking like Dendum now."
</p><p>Khoal yells, "To the market!"
</p><p>Nisugi asks, "How are the eviction laws?"
</p><p>Through a weathered driftwood portal, you hear Erienne yell, "Trouble is afoot!"
</p><p>Speaking to Kaonashi, Yardie says, "Well done."
</p><p>Kaonashi softly says, "Thank you.  Seriously."
