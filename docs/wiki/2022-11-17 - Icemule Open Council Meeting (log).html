<b>Gespry melodically says, "Ok then."</b>
</p><p>Gespry stands up.
</p><p>You turn to face Gespry.
</p><p>Sorlu nods slightly.
</p><p>[Clovertooth, Council Chambers]
</p><p>Lit by a quartet of heavy silver candelabras, the chambers are a spacious, windowless stone den with lush tapestries hanging from the walls.  The hangings muffle echoes in the chamber to a muted whisper.  Spaced around a paneled hoarbeam table are a number of patterned leather chairs, each well-maintained.  The sole means of egress from the chamber appears to be a pair of Ossian pine doors, each marked with a rampant mule in silver.  You also see a whitewashed willow table edged by scrollwork in varying shades of violet with some stuff on it, a massive snowy white tiger, an inlaid leather grimoire soaring around with its gilt-swept ethereal violet pinions, a yellow-eyed silvery lor mandrake sprouting yellow primroses, the web-draped Missoni disk, the repousse copper Perigourd disk raised in leafy designs, a lazy wild blood red dog, a stocky snow white puppy with oversized black-tipped paws and a vine-carved cherrywood cart with some stuff on it.
Also here: Zeminar, Bakarus, Commodore Nodyre who is sitting, Roelon who is sitting, Lady Erienne, Lord Randsford, Grutak, Lady Aliashyrah, Perigourd, Missoni, Lord Sorlu who is sitting, Merrymaker Gespry, Chronicler Falvicar who is sitting
Obvious exits: none
Roelon dusts off his black woolen kilt.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Grutak, "We are fortunate that Bakarus has been returned to his right mind. Surely you cannot be among the small minded who cannot understand the sway he was under."
</p><p>Missoni glances skeptically around the room.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "We actually have all five council members present tonight.  and Since he didn't get a chance last time to introduce himself."</b>
</p><p>Gespry nods at Nodyre.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "Claims to be under..."
</p><p>Perigourd raises an eyebrow.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Nodyre.
</p><p>You beam happily at Nodyre!
</p><p>Roelon nods slowly.
</p><p>Missoni rests a gentle hand on Perigourd's arm.
</p><p>Randsford says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "Returned for now, but remains to be seen.  I fear Zeban is not truly gone.  He will be our beacon if he were to return."
</p><p>Randsford glances at Bakarus.
</p><p>Randsford nods slowly at Bakarus.
</p><p>Perigourd shakes his head.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods slowly at Randsford.
</p><p>Bakarus says, speaking to Randsford, "I trust he has been destroyed."
</p><p>Bakarus nods.
</p><p>Randsford says, speaking to Bakarus, "Time will tell."
</p><p>Gespry nods slowly.
</p><p>Bakarus says, "Though it is clear the damage lingers."
</p><p>Perigourd nods in agreement at Missoni.
</p><p>Bakarus says, "As we have seen."
</p><p>Randsford nods in agreement at Bakarus.
</p><p>Aliashyrah settles herself comfortably in one of the leather chairs.
</p><p>Grutak turns an inquisitive ear toward Nodyre.
</p><p>You cough.
</p><p>Aliashyrah gently runs a hand across her turquoise pit viper, gently trailing fingers across its form in a delicate caress.
</p><p>Roelon says, speaking deeply to Bakarus, "Such things, history has proven, cannae be taken lightly."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "We thought him gone before."
</p><p>Roelon shrugs.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically asks, "Who wishes to start then?"</b>
</p><p>Gespry surveys the area.
</p><p>Bakarus sits down.
</p><p>Lady Elliathe just came through a pair of Ossian pine doors.
</p><p>Missoni gazes with interest at her surroundings.
</p><p>Elliathe sits down.
</p><p>Roelon surveys the area.
</p><p>Sorlu whispers to the group, "I'd like to go last tonight, if that's okay."
</p><p>Gespry nods.
</p><p>Bakarus takes a drink from his wight wine.
</p><p>Zeminar inhales deeply upon his pipe, puckering his lips and sending out three rings of smoke before him briefly.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "Ok, I'll start then."</b>
</p><p>Nodyre chuckles.
</p><p>Sorlu grins at Gespry.
</p><p>Randsford whispers something to Roelon.
</p><p>You whisper, "I can go next." to your group.
</p><p>Roelon nods slowly.
</p><p><b>You quietly say, "Unless Nodyre wants to say something."</b>
</p><p>Randsford nods in agreement at Grutak.
</p><p>Aliashyrah gazes with interest at Nodyre.
</p><p>You peer quizzically at Nodyre.
</p><p>Nodyre blinks.
</p><p><b>Nodyre says, "I do not..."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu whispers to the group, "Then Roelon after Opalina, and then me....I'm not sure if Nodyre wishes to speak, but I'm sure we can squeeze him in."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking helpfully to Nodyre, "All the other members gave a short introduction, of sorts."
</p><p>Sorlu whispers to the group, "Ah, well that answers that."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Nodyre, "I believe they want to offer you the same opportunity."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "I've nothing to add."
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods once at Nodyre.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "He wishes to take over the world."
</p><p>Grutak asks, "What's not to know?"
</p><p>Sorlu grins at Grutak.
</p><p>Sorlu turns an inquisitive ear toward Gespry.
</p><p>You listen carefully to Gespry.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "Welcome everyone, We are gathered here, to discuss a few topics, bring news for those who may have missed out on the happenings of late, and to ask for your help on a few things.  and of course listen to new ideas.."</b>
</p><p>Missoni nods appreciatively.
<b></b>
Gespry melodically says, "But first, let me introduce a special guest for tonight, Commander Grutak, of the Icemule militia."<b></b>
</p><p>Gespry nods at Grutak.
</p><p>Missoni takes a drink from her winter rose tea.
</p><p>You applaud Grutak.
</p><p>Randsford hoots.
</p><p>Grutak nods in greeting.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in greeting at Grutak.
</p><p>Sorlu applauds Grutak.
</p><p>Roelon stands up.
</p><p>Aliashyrah applauds Grutak politely.
</p><p>Roelon turns toward Grutak and renders a sharp hand salute.
</p><p>Roelon nods.
</p><p>Roelon settles himself comfortably in one of the leather chairs.
</p><p>Elliathe smiles at Grutak.
</p><p>Bakarus says, speaking to Grutak, "The city is lucky to have you."
</p><p>Bakarus smiles.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Bakarus, "Darn right."
</p><p>Aliashyrah smiles quietly to herself.
</p><p>Perigourd scratches at his beard.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "For those who may or may not know, Grutak has again re-taken command of the militia, and for those who may have intrest in this defense organization, please talk with him or a representative."</b>
</p><p>Nodyre gazes heavenward.
</p><p><b>Gespry says, speaking melodically to Grutak, "If you have anything to add, now would be a good time."</b>
</p><p>Grutak grins at Nodyre.
</p><p><b>Grutak says, speaking to Gespry, "I will speak my peace after Sorlu."</b>
</p><p>Gespry nods.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "Fair enough."</b>
</p><p>Gespry whispers, "Want to cover the new OSA area?"
</p><p>You nod at Gespry.
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "Ok then, Opalina has new information into our newly opened shipping routes."</b>
</p><p>Gespry forcefully crosses one arm over his leather bodysuit and offers you a formal bow.
</p><p>Gespry sits down.
</p><p>Bakarus turns to face you.
</p><p>Bakarus takes a drink from his wight wine.
</p><p><b>You quietly say, "Some of the local news that we'd like to announce if you haven't already heard is that we have a some new docks open just outside of the west gate."</b>
</p><p><b>You quietly say, "You can either move your ships through the boating movers or sail there yourself."</b>
</p><p>Nodyre looks over at Gespry and shakes his head.
</p><p>Sorlu flashes a wide grin.
</p><p>Sorlu nods to you.
</p><p>Elliathe ponders.
</p><p>Missoni nods approvingly.
</p><p>Missoni takes a drink from her winter rose tea.
</p><p><b>You quietly say, "We do not have a repair dock yet so please be prepaired to fix in either landing or in Kraken falls."</b>
<b></b>
Aliashyrah cocks her hips to one side, then the other, and her turquoise pit viper moves with the motion, undulating as it slithers up her torso, coming to a rest draped across her shoulders.
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Gespry.
</p><p>Missoni takes a bite of her truffle-infused cheese.
</p><p><b>You quietly say, "It's rumored we will see that built soon."</b>
</p><p><b>You quietly ask, "Any questions about the docks?"</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah gently runs a hand across her turquoise pit viper, gently trailing fingers across its form in a delicate caress.
</p><p>Aliashyrah looks over at you and shakes her head.
</p><p>You smile at Aliashyrah.
</p><p><i>Elliathe raises her hand.</i>
</p><p><b>You quietly say, "Yes."</b>
</p><p>You smile at Elliathe.
</p><p>Gespry takes a drink from his cinnamon coffee.
</p><p>Erienne takes a drink from her bubbly champagne.
</p><p><b>Elliathe asks, "I am not sure if this question fits here or with the Militia, but with the docks, I had wondered if we were also forming a navy?"</b>
</p><p>Elliathe cocks her head at you.
</p><p>Roelon rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p><b>Grutak says, "I will speak to that after Sorlu."</b>
</p><p>Nodyre chuckles.
</p><p>Roelon grins.
</p><p><b>You quietly exclaim, "That is a great question!"</b>
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Grutak, "Ambitious, are we?"
</p><p>Gespry chuckles.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Nodyre, "Go big or go home."
</p><p>Missoni takes a bite of her truffle-infused cheese.
</p><p>Grutak winks at Nodyre.
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles.
</p><p>Missoni takes a drink from her winter rose tea.
</p><p><b>Elliathe says, "Tis just that the Empire seems to bent on.... expansion these days."</b>
</p><p>Elliathe shakes her head.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "We are home...But still go big."
</p><p>Roelon winks at Grutak.
</p><p>Missoni cocks her head.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Elliathe.
</p><p><b>Sorlu whispers aloud, speaking quietly to Elliathe, "We'll be addressing that."</b>
</p><p>Gespry whispers something to Nodyre.
</p><p><b>You quietly say, "If the militia is setting something up you are welcome to join. however you will always be welcome to start one."</b>
</p><p>Roelon nods slowly.
</p><p>Perigourd grabs a robust dark maoral pipe from a raw leather bag cinched with braided maoral roots inside of his green suede cloak.
</p><p>Perigourd lights his dark maoral pipe, placing it to his lips to take a contented puff as some yellow tendrils of fragrant smoke rise up about him.
</p><p>You nod.
</p><p>Elliathe nods at Sorlu.
</p><p>Elliathe clasps her hand over her mouth.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "Nothing else, I am sorry I disurpted the order of things."
</p><p>Elliathe's cheeks flush with a soft shade of apricot.
</p><p><b>You quietly say, "If no other questions on the docks I'll hand the baton over to Roelon."</b>
</p><p>Nodyre whispers something to Gespry.
</p><p>Roelon stands up.
</p><p><i>You say, speaking quietly to Elliathe, "Your question was wonderful thank you."</i>
</p><p>Bakarus takes a drink from his wight wine.
</p><p>Elliathe nods once.
</p><p>Elliathe blushes and babbles a few incoherent words, looking sincerely flustered.
</p><p>Gespry pours himself a whipped cream-topped cinnamon coffee.
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply says, "The thing about kilts.  Oh, ah mean. As many of ye already know, we found the old farmlands to the west, and the land of Moonsedge."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu grins at Roelon.
</p><p>Gespry nods slowly.
</p><p><i>Gespry melodically says, "Besides the docks."</i>
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply says, "Among it, the poor village of the half Krolvin at the Crawling shore."</b>
</p><p>Perigourd brings the dark maoral pipe to his lips and inhales deeply of its lemon-scent, then abruptly exhales some yellow streams of smoke from his nose.
</p><p>Sorlu adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>Jurist of Eye Leifa just came through a pair of Ossian pine doors.
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply says, "Zeban has left behind his experiments there sadly. It is quite dangerous.  And as we hae known, lord Barlan has taken advantage of this."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu nods slowly at Roelon.
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply says, "And twisted his own people into what we know as vampires."</b>
</p><p>Bakarus frowns.
</p><p>Missoni frowns.
</p><p>You sigh.
</p><p>Sorlu shudders.
</p><p>You quietly say, "It's truely sad."
</p><p>Elliathe's face turns slightly pale.
</p><p>Perigourd puffs rapidly on his dark maoral pipe, some yellow wisps of fragrant lemon-scented smoke dancing about him.
</p><p>Bakarus agrees with you.
</p><p>You listen carefully to Roelon.
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply says, "Though ah venture in there many times to cleanse it...it is filled with such horror it filled yir very being."</b>
</p><p>A slight shiver courses through your body as you shake off the cold.
</p><p>Roelon nods slowly.
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "I got to scrap his dead body off the ground once already."
</p><p>Gespry nods at Roelon.
</p><p>Sorlu appears to be trying hard not to grin.
</p><p>A pained expression crosses Missoni's face.
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply says, "We are keeping an eye over there to be sure. Aye..nae even the kilt is safe from them."</b>
</p><p>Elliathe winces.
</p><p>Randsford says, speaking to Gespry, "I left a few of his limbs in there too."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Gespry, "Always a fun time."
</p><p>Randsford flashes Roelon a wolfish grin.
</p><p>Gespry nods at Grutak.
</p><p>Gespry turns an inquisitive ear toward Roelon.
</p><p>Leifa's look of renewed cognition fades.
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply says, "Even the Crawling shores has lesser beings of these vampires."</b>
</p><p>Perigourd brings the dark maoral pipe to his lips and inhales deeply of its lemon-scent, then abruptly exhales some yellow streams of smoke from his nose.
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply says, "But be warned, it is just as deadly."</b>
</p><p>Leifa pours herself a glass of hibiscus-coconut rum.
</p><p>Leifa put a sleek villswood runestaff in her storm blue silk pelisse.
</p><p>You nod.
</p><p>Falvicar nods.
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply asks, "Did any hae questions regardin' the castle or the shore?"</b>
</p><p>You gaze about with intense interest, your brilliant cerulean eyes pausing to briefly inspect the situation in their path.
</p><p>Aliashyrah looks over at Roelon and shakes her head.
</p><p>Roelon nods slowly.
</p><p><i>Gespry melodically says, "Both these areas also have this tendancy to strip off foreign spells..quite intense."</i>
</p><p>Nodyre nods at Gespry.
</p><p>Zeminar rubs his orb of ether, causing shadows to coalesce and enshroud him completely.
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply says, "Then ah give ye to the hands of Sorlu."</b>
</p><p>Roelon's eyes suddenly flash with a deep sanguine glow.
</p><p>Roelon turns to face Sorlu.
</p><p>Roelon playfully flips the folds of his black woolen kilt.
</p><p>Leifa takes a drink from her coconut rum.
</p><p>Leifa looks rather relaxed.
</p><p>Gespry nods at Sorlu.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles.
</p><p>Sorlu nods once.
</p><p>Sorlu stands up.
</p><p><i>You quietly say, "And it's quite scary can send you to your knees even if your very brave."</i>
</p><p><b>Sorlu warmly greets, "Good evening, Icemule."</b>
</p><p><i>Sorlu casually glances around the room.</i>
</p><p>Aliashyrah settles her gaze on Sorlu, watching him intently.
</p><p>You listen carefully to Sorlu.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in greeting at Sorlu.
</p><p>Elliathe nods in greeting at Sorlu.
</p><p>Sorlu leans leisurely on his Nalfein-styled cane, a thoughtful expression upon his face.
</p><p><b>Sorlu direly says, "Tonight I will be discussing some alarming news that many of you may be aware of already..."</b>
</p><p>Roelon settles himself comfortably in one of the leather chairs.
</p><p>Sorlu nods glumly.
</p><p>Sorlu slowly empties his lungs.
</p><p>Sorlu excitedly insists, "But first..."
</p><p>Elliathe furrows her brow.
</p><p>Sorlu flashes a wide grin.
</p><p><b>Sorlu boasts, "Let us take a moment to applaud one another. Under the incorruptible leadership of the Council of Five, we have still not had a single murder at the hands of the golden-eyed serial killer.  Through our diligence, and your own, we have put an end to his nefarious game. We can now all but confirm that he has fled town to find easier prey. Well done, Icemule!"</b>
</p><p>Sorlu applauds encouragingly.
</p><p>Aliashyrah grins slowly.
</p><p>Aliashyrah applauds warmly.
</p><p>Nodyre rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p><b>Sorlu quietly murmurs, "There have been a few other murders, but those are different and don't count..."</b>
</p><p>Missoni smiles.
</p><p>Sorlu applauds loudly.
</p><p>Roelon smiles.
</p><p>Perigourd glances skeptically at Sorlu.
</p><p>Leifa looks about with a puzzled expression on her face.
</p><p>Sorlu clears his throat.
</p><p>Elliathe applauds.
</p><p>Bakarus applauds.
</p><p>Aliashyrah laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.
</p><p>Sorlu nods.
</p><p><i>Gespry melodically says, "No un-expected murders in town at least."</i>
</p><p>Bakarus takes a drink from his wight wine.
</p><p><b>Sorlu seriously continues, "However, in the last few weeks the Turamzzyrian Empire has begun to, once again, spread its influence by claiming additional lands that were west and north of their borders."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu frowns.
</p><p>Roelon sighs.
</p><p>Perigourd says, "One would be curious how you know he has moved on."
</p><p>Perigourd chuckles.
</p><p>Grutak gazes confidently at his surroundings.
</p><p>Roelon nods slowly at Sorlu.
</p><p>Sorlu surreptitiously glances at Perigourd.
</p><p>Missoni folds her hands.

</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking politely to Nodyre, "Is the council above reproach or questioning then? His matter of address was rough and ill-conceived, but I do not think it should be said that the council cannot be accused."
</p><p>Falvicar says, "Did I say I was going to kill you?  Have I a reason other than your false accusations of my wife being a thief?  What would the point be of it?  You're on a hunt to find a thief that took a note but you assume it was her because she's the first you see according to you..."
</p><p>Aenternoll smirks at Bakarus.
</p><p>Randsford says, "None of this changes the fact that real threats are upon us."
</p><p>Aenternoll offers Bakarus a glass of Dhe'nari blood wine.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Randsford, "I don't think so, no."
</p><p>Erienne asks, "I would like to interject for a moment, if I may?"
</p><p>Bakarus says, speaking to Aenternoll, "Ahh, thank you my friend."
</p><p>Bakarus accepts Aenternoll's Dhe'nari blood wine.
</p><p>Sorlu says, "I believe, considering the parties involved, that this be brought before Teaberry for mediation."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "And of course not - but there was no evidence presented."
</p><p>Aenternoll joins Bakarus's group.
</p><p>You agree with Erienne.
Sorlu says, "That is how I vote."
</p><p>Sorlu nods once.
</p><p>Aenternoll says, in Dhe'narsi, something you don't understand.
</p><p>Randsford asks, speaking to Nodyre, "Expel people willing to lay their lives for this town merely because you disagree with one individual?"
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "And I'm sure you heard the accusation of collusion with enemies."
</p><p>Missoni confusedly asks, "What was on this note?"
</p><p>Aenternoll removes a glass of Dhe'nari blood wine from in his dark purple cloak.
</p><p>Aenternoll just closed a tattered and heavy dark purple cloak.
</p><p>Sorlu says, "Otherwise, we will be left with...chaos."
</p><p>Elliathe says, "As someone outside of the situation and unbaised? The only accusation I heard was of aggressive behaviour, not of any fell deed. Unless I misunderstood."
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Randsford, "Who said anything about expulsion?"
</p><p>Perigourd begins chuckling at Missoni!
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Emotions are high, aye. With the reveal of Barlan and his madness and our golden eyed fiend still on the loose...."
</p><p>You shrug at Missoni.
</p><p>Randsford says, "Cut ties with the militia."
</p><p>Missoni gazes in amusement at Perigourd.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Nodyre, "Perhaps not, but Opalina handled it better than you did, which should tell you that perhaps your reaction is beyond what is warranted as well."
</p><p>Gespry says, speaking melodically to Aliashyrah, "If he has an accusation to make, them let him make it officially and in the right place.  but his word against another.  with no other witnesses is not also above reproach."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "But we cannae start to point our fingers at each other so quickly."
</p><p>Erienne says, "What I heard did not sound like a direct accusation.  Just a statement of a few facts and a direct question of involvement.  It does not mean she is guilty of anything."
</p><p>Randsford nods in agreement at Erienne.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking calmly to you, "You have acted with grace and calm throughout. I commend you."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Elliathe, "The man said clearly: "Perhaps she is in collusion with the Hunter."."
</p><p>Nodyre says, "That is an accusation most foul."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Perhaps you should consult the mayor before engaging any proceedings and gain his opinion as well."
</p><p>Nodyre says, "And supported by no evidence."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "I expect he'll have one."
</p><p>Gespry melodically says, "Ok, before this resolves itself into utter chaos.  we still have a few other things to discuss."
</p><p>Erienne says, "Speculation."
</p><p>Erienne waves her hand in a dismissive gesture.
</p><p>Aenternoll whispers something to Bakarus.
</p><p>Roelon says, speaking deeply to Erienne, "Aye. But he is ah intense one he is. It seems it is taken in ah negative way."
</p><p>Elliathe says, "I fear I do not know who this Hunter is, being more newly come to those parts."
</p><p>Roelon rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Erienne says, "Quite irrelevant."
</p><p>Erienne agrees with Roelon.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "He passion for the town is strong. Aye."
</p><p>Nodyre says, "As is his bloodlust."
</p><p>Sorlu agrees, speaking to you, "You did weather that storm quite well. I applaud you."
</p><p>Sorlu nods to you.
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Aliashyrah, "I am a bit confused to be honest. I am curious to know what more he has to say."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "But ah cool hand is needed on ah sharp blade. Else ye but yirself."
</p><p>Falvicar nods once.
</p><p>Erienne agrees with Roelon.
</p><p>Gespry surveys the area.
</p><p>Aenternoll takes a drink from his Dhe'nari blood wine.
</p><p>Roelon glances at some steaming whiskey-spiked coffee in his hand.
</p><p>You quietly say, "He is definitly a hot headed one. I hope someone can calm him down enough to return."
</p><p>Roelon put some steaming whiskey-spiked coffee in his leather travel pack.
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "I got the feeling you and I and Gespry and Roelon will need to find the thief since Grutak seems otherwise unable to do it himself."
</p><p>Nodyre laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.
</p><p>Erienne ponders.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to you, "I have thought to him and hope he will listen."
</p><p>Nodyre says, "Nothing of value was lost."
</p><p>Nodyre waves his hand in a dismissive gesture.
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Aliashyrah, "Thank you."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "I believe he was under the impression that you wished to fight."
</p><p>Bakarus takes a drink from his Dhe'nari blood wine.
</p><p>Aliashyrah thoughtfully studies Falvicar, a satisfied expression quickly reaching her face.
</p><p>Roelon takes a drink from his whiskey-spiked coffee.
</p><p>Randsford gazes heavenward.
</p><p>You ask, speaking quietly to Nodyre, "Not like 10mil from the town coffers?"
</p><p>You wink at Nodyre.
</p><p>Roelon slowly empties his lungs.
</p><p>Randsford says, "If I may have a moment to speak openly and shift our conversation at the real thread."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to you, "A paltry sum."
</p><p>Sorlu leans over and whispers, "Please, do try to keep Falvicar and Grutak from spilling each other's blood. You know how men are."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking frankly to Nodyre, "I find your dismissive and mocking attitude rather unbecoming of your position in the same manner that you censure Grutak for his behavior."
</p><p><b>You quietly ask, "Sorlu you mentioned seeing a letter on the alter, do you remember what it said?"</b>
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "Ok, if I may.  I'm asking those here to take a few minutes.  and if they can come up with a civic town improvement they'd like to see brought forth in this town.  please feel free to mail your suggestion to any of the town councilors here.  but for the time being try to send them to Me.  till the next meeting."</b>
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "The empire expandin' is still ah possible threat. But perhaps something we should speak with to the Councilors of the south."
</p><p>Aliashyrah begins chuckling at Gespry!
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "It's a good thing I care not for your opinion."
</p><p>Nodyre winks at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Grutak just came through a pair of Ossian pine doors.
</p><p>Grutak slowly empties his lungs.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, speaking to you, "It was a short note that was left."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu nods to you.
</p><p>Roelon takes a drink from his whiskey-spiked coffee.
</p><p>Randsford sighs.
</p><p>You ask, speaking quietly to Sorlu, "Do you recall any part of it?"
</p><p>Erienne nods at Grutak.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, speaking to you, "I do not recall it word-for-word, but it stated something along the lines of..."</b>
</p><p>You listen carefully to Sorlu.
</p>
<pre>Sorlu recites:
</pre>
<pre>   <b>"There is only one prey left worth taking. Its name is Dabbings"</b>
</pre>
<p>Nodyre blinks.
</p><p>Sorlu nods slowly.
</p><p>Perigourd says, speaking to Roelon, "The empire isn't crossing the Locksmehr. I don't see that they have any interest to either."
</p><p>Missoni frowns.
</p><p>Roelon furrows his brow.
</p><p>Missoni's eyes narrow, and her expression darkens as she swiftly averts her gaze downward.
</p><p>Roelon nods at Perigourd.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Sounds distressing."
</p><p>Randsford says, "Seems fitting.  Not a coincidence I am afraid."
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "I reported this to Grutak. The note was left beside a piece of quartz, on that altar...cats-eye quartz."</b>
</p><p>Roelon says, speaking deeply to Perigourd, "But those of the empire hae greedy minds. In mah experience."
</p><p><b>You quietly say, "Oh wait.. that cats-eye quartz was mine."</b>
</p><p>Perigourd says, speaking to Roelon, "I am of the empire, and I want very little that I don't earn for myself."
</p><p><b>Gespry melodically says, "For those still here.  we are done with the general meeting.  if you want to join in speculation and other note related issues.  stay and discuss to your hearts content.  But I'll be putting the cart back in town center for general consuption."</b>
</p><p>You quietly say, "I mentioned trying to open the door there."
</p><p>Sorlu asks, speaking to you, "And was the note as well?"
</p><p>Gespry nods at Nodyre.
</p><p>Sorlu raises an eyebrow in your direction.
</p><p>Gespry nods at Sorlu.
</p><p>Aliashyrah reasonably asks, "Is it not possible that the Hunter had another means of reaching the altar and took them?"
</p><p>Gespry nods at Roelon.
</p><p>Gespry nods to you.
</p><p>Aliashyrah asks, speaking to you, "The door perhaps?"
</p><p>Gespry stands up.
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Sorlu, "Sadly not the note. However the note and the quarts were not there."
</p><p>Gespry leans down and pulls the hand brake free of the wheels.  The cherrywood cart rolls toward him and then stops, as if waiting.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Gespry, "Good evening then, sir."
</p><p>Roelon says, speaking deeply to Sorlu, "Did nae notice any note."
</p><p>Merrymaker Gespry just went through a pair of Ossian pine doors.
</p><p>Roelon nods at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Charging forward, the mandrake opens her mouth in a silent scream and throws her arms in the air as she rushes at Missoni.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Is what ah was thinking."
</p><p>You quietly say, "When I returned to my investigations to entering the door."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "We cannae pass through it."
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "So you are aware, I did promise him that he'd have to go through me if he goes after you."
</p><p>Falvicar nods to you.
</p><p>Sorlu says, "Then someone, or something, got to them....and this is what has fired up Grutak, and rightfully so it seems."
</p><p>Sorlu rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Roelon deeply asks, "But whats to stop the Hunter?"
</p><p>You wrap Falvicar in a tender embrace.
</p><p>Missoni nods slowly.
</p><p>Falvicar wraps you in a tender embrace.
</p><p>Erienne agrees with Sorlu.
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Falvicar, "Keep the peace my love keep the peace."
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Falvicar, "I know you will protect me."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "The Hunter is ah threat. Ah would think he'd enjoy turning us against each other."
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "I'm trying to teach him how to be rational."
</p><p>Bakarus takes a drink from his Dhe'nari blood wine.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "More so since we found that place."
</p><p>Roelon takes a drink from his whiskey-spiked coffee.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in agreement at Roelon.
</p><p>Sorlu says, "I do not know if it was Opalina, or someone else...but that note I did see, with my very own eyes."
</p><p>Sorlu nods once.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in agreement at Sorlu.
</p><p>Missoni agrees with Perigourd.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "If that's the case it seems they are being successful thus far."
</p><p>Missoni traces a finger over her rose gold tile.  A small spark follows the path of her finger across the tile.
</p><p>Elliathe sighs deeply.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Sorlu, "Good intelligence this - if only that was the focus of the discussion rather than unfounded accusations."
</p><p>Missoni takes a drink from her Northern Fury mead.
</p><p>Missoni gasps for breath after she swallows a large draught of mead.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "But if this note did say as such. That means Dabbings, be is our Mayor or his cousin, are in danger."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "This town if full of passionate people. There has been no harm tonight that cannot be forgiven or moved past."
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "A thief has no reason to stick around after the theft is done."
</p><p>Perigourd whispers, "I can't imagine you'd be in league with the hunter, so hopefully these claims fall away without issue."
</p><p>Perigourd nods to you.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Well if anything I do have to say this.. That note may indicate a need to protect our Dabbins."
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement at Roelon.
</p><p>Sorlu says, "I will continue to strive to serve the town by gathering what more I might."
</p><p>Missoni agrees with you.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods slowly to you.
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Nodyre.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to you, "Methinks the mayor can protect himself fairly well."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to you, "To say nothing of his reaction to us trying to coddle him."
</p><p>Nodyre chuckles.
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Nodyre, "Every little bit helps."
</p><p>Missoni says, "I am afraid we must away."
</p><p>Missoni waves.
</p><p>Falvicar waves.
</p><p>Missoni wishes, "Farewell."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Fair eve."
</p><p>Falvicar wiggles his ears.
</p><p>Bakarus nods.
</p><p>Missoni's group flounces through a pair of Ossian pine doors amidst a diffuse cloud of prismatic glitter.
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Grutak, "And your group would be needed to add any extra protection we can have to his safety."
</p><p>Aliashyrah curiously asks, "Was this note or its contents discussed with the mayor?"
</p><p><b>Sorlu asks, speaking to Grutak, "Can the militia spare a few extra troops to keep an eye on Talliver?"</b>
</p><p><b>Randsford says, "The events described this evening I see as no mere coincidence.  Here we are at each others throats; similarly not heading warnings of Bakarus when Darcena spoke.  The accusations here are painful but no different.  These conversations are important to have, civily, if for not other reason than to speak openly rather than in the shadows.  The real threat is the Empire encroaching, not each of us.  Mayor Talliver's vision is coming true; I fear war is upon us.  Turning on each other will not aid this but further lead to the occupation of this very town."</b>
</p><p>Randsford gazes heavenward.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Sorlu, "That will depend on the Mayor."
</p><p>Bakarus stands up.
</p><p>Grutak says, "We do take orders from him."
</p><p>Falvicar ponders.
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement at Randsford.
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Randsford, "Curious I am - why do you think the Empire would have any desire to expand this far north?"
</p><p>You agree with Randsford.
</p><p>Sorlu agrees with Randsford.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in agreement at Randsford.
</p><p>Randsford asks, "Why wouldnt they?"
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Randsford, "Supply chain issues for one."
</p><p>Randsford says, "Power if nothing else."
</p><p>Randsford says, "To send a message."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Land and useful land at that."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Grutak, "You may need to be persuassive. He tends to resist protection."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to you, "There is plenty of land that is not frozen."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Nodyre, "Airships can be anywhere anytime.  They proved that when they brought a fleet to Icemule."
</p><p>Elliathe asks, "Evenif they didn't they clearly are encrouching on the Landing. What if they decide to cut off our trade route and travel to the South, isolating us that way?"
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Grutak, "He still views the world as a warrior and often forgets that he has other duties as the mayor."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Moonsedge docks, being close to Briarmoon cove could be one."
</p><p>Sorlu says, "These lands hold plenty of value...as Ta'Vaalor has already shown previously with their use of intimidation to gain access to it."
</p><p>Nodyre asks, "Until the Empire actually shows any ill intent to Icemule, perhaps we just be cautious and wary instead of outwardly aggressive?"
</p><p>Roelon rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Nodyre raises an eyebrow in Grutak's direction.
</p><p>Randsford nods at Roelon.
</p><p>Randsford nods in agreement at Sorlu.
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Nodyre, "The land just outside the docks is quite fertile."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "However. It is something to nae shy an eye from. To act upon with war? nae."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to you, "And crawling with undead."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "The oath of every Regular is to obey the lawful orders of the Mayor."
</p><p>Nodyre chuckles.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "But to keep ah guard up? aye."
</p><p>You quietly say, "The farms are not."
</p><p>Randsford says, "We are in the middle of a war I fear may come between the two empires.  This puts us squarely in the middle."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Grutak, "I am not suggesting otherwise. I said be persuassive."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to you, "I've already seen the moonsedge foes expanding beyond the briar gate."
</p><p>Aliashyrah flashes a quick grin at Grutak.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "And as Grutak has mentioned earlier....as it now stands, the Human Empire could cut us off from the Landing at the snap of a finger. Not that it would bother me nearly as much as it would bother many of the local merchants who travel there for commerce."</b>
</p><p>Randsford says, "Why else woudl this Hunter want Talliver dead?  He clearly had a glimpse of what may come to pass."
</p><p>You bite your lip.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Sorlu, "We now have docks that allow us unfettered access up and down the coast."
</p><p><i>Bakarus says, speaking to Sorlu, "The Vaalorians and their looking at Icemule as a weak "partner" is a concern as well.  Even during my time on the council, it was often spoken about from the citizenry."</i>
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods rhythmically at Randsford.
</p><p>Randsford nods at Bakarus.
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Nodyre, "And not all halflings here have a boat to load their flour onto."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Sorlu, "Along with access to the elven nations by means of the Cold River village."
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "Here's something to use... my love."
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Bakarus.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Sorlu, "Boats can be purchased - resources are available."
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "Talliver was at our wedding."
</p><p><b>Randsford says, "I leave it to the council to decide how we should react and plan to these events that have been laid before us.  However; I do feel we need to send a strong message to these new so called Barons.  Boarders and lines must be drawn.  If they can encroach on the landing it is only a matter of time before they choose to encroach towards Icemule."</b>
</p><p>Falvicar nods to you.
</p><p>Elliathe says, "Anyone can sail those waters though, and create a potential blockade."
</p><p>Aliashyrah asks, speaking to Nodyre, "Are you offering your coffers to the local merchants if needed?"
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Nodyre, "Unless you are purchasing them for us all...there is still a matter of the coins needed."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "My wealth is always available to worthy causes."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Sorlu, "As are my ships."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Elliathe, "In response to your question, the Regulars have a fleet."
</p><p>Aenternoll takes a drink from his Dhe'nari blood wine.
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Falvicar, "How would I use that?"
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Bakarus, "And yes...you are quite right. Vaalor has made it quite known that they see us an an inferior, backwater hovel that they can tread upon. No longer will that be the case."
</p><p>Grutak says, "We currently have 3 ships and are expanding."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Randsford, "I believe you have spoken rationally and wisely. The coucil woudl do well to consider your words."
</p><p>Sorlu says, "And if they aren't aware, they need be made aware."
</p><p>Nodyre laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.
</p><p>Elliathe nods at Grutak.
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Bakarus.
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "Shows we our friendly with him."
</p><p>Roelon grins.
</p><p>Bakarus agrees with Sorlu.
</p><p>Randsford bows to Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods slightly at Randsford.
</p><p>Roelon nods slowly at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Nodyre says, "Starting conflicts on two fronts seems very wise."
</p><p>Bakarus says, "I can attest, Randsford is a good man and has Icemule first in his wishes."
</p><p>Nodyre laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.
</p><p>Randsford says, "I seek to only see our town prosper.  We must prepare for any potential refuges from Landing.  I fear it will come to this."
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Bakarus.
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "Let alone the talks while we were on the airship on the way to Hinterwinds."
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement at Randsford.
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Randsford, "I have seen you often enough to know this is the case."
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Randsford.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Preparin' does nae mean we go to war."
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in agreement at Roelon.
</p><p>Randsford nods in agreement at Roelon.
</p><p>Grutak sighs.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "But it also means we don get cought with our kilts down."
</p><p>Elliathe says, "We do not need to be agressive in order to simply be prepared."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Roelon, "What makes you think we aren't already at war."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Elliathe, "Wise words - but that also means that our militia leader needs to temper his aggression."
</p><p>Nodyre glances at Grutak.
</p><p>Grutak says, "You can't wish away the actions of Vaalor or the Empire."
</p><p>You agree with Roelon.
</p><p>Sorlu agrees with Grutak.
</p><p>Roelon says, speaking deeply to Grutak, "With the empire? First, they must deal with hard headed Thadston."
</p><p>Sorlu says, "This is true."
</p><p>Grutak says, "You can either roll with it, or get rolled over."
</p><p>Randsford asks, speaking to Grutak, "Perhaps we are, perhaps not.  It is you who told me to watch the gates instead of worry of the fronts was it not?"
</p><p>Randsford peers quizzically at Grutak.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "It is wise to heed warnings. To dismiss them as preposterous or mock those who raise concerns is evidence of small mindedness that could prove fatal."
</p><p>Randsford says, speaking to Grutak, "So let us fortify and prepare for any eventuality."
</p><p>Nodyre says, "There is no war upon us from either The Empire or Ta'Vaalor - this is craziness."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "'Vaalor, could be an issue if they pressed upon our treaty. One we really need to get rid of."
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Randsford, "My job IS to watch the fronts."
</p><p>Grutak begins chuckling at Randsford!
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "Nothing else, shows you had respect and friendship with the mayor then as you do right now."
</p><p>Nodyre asks, "Perhaps we focus on one effort at a time?"
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "However. Our issue right now is this Hunter."
</p><p>Elliathe says, "I love the freedom of Icemule, I say this as someone who grew up under the chain that was Chaston's Edict."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Nodyre, "And there won't be if we have a strong show of force."
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Sorlu, "From your perspective, which is the graver threat? The Empire or Ta'Vaalor's faulty treaty?"
</p><p>Elliathe says, "I do not want to see the Empire come here. I escaped for a reson."
</p><p>Randsford says, speaking to Grutak, "And you shall.  Seek an audience with this Gnul he is a potential ally.  Though he terrorizes landing he could be of aid if the empire encrouches."
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Falvicar, "If it comes to that my love I will remember."
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Nodyre, "Do you believe that Vaalor has the right to march through OUR lands? Speak plainly, yes or no."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Grutak, "We would be demolished by either of these foes should we take them on - you know this."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "He has already killed many of our town. Though he will think twice about ah gardener."
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "I almost want to put a wager up that Grutak will go after me next since I do have a relationship with Thadston after that promise I gave to him (Grutak)."
</p><p>Sorlu raises an eyebrow in Nodyre's direction.
</p><p>Falvicar grins at you.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Sorlu, "Of course not - I think it would be wise to negotiate an end to the treaty that a former mayor signed."
</p><p>Randsford nods in agreement at Nodyre.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Sorlu, "But keep Grutak away from those negotiations, for goodness' sake."
</p><p>Roelon grins at Nodyre.
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Sorlu, "And yes sorry, I do believe Grutak is the giant from the letter."
</p><p>Randsford says, speaking to Nodyre, "There will come a time when we will need his tactics.  Our enemies will show no mercy and neither will he."
</p><p>Grutak says, "I intend to keep the Glacier open."
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Nodyre, "We do not need to negotiate our right to rule our own land. We need simply declare it...Icemule is our land, not theirs."
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "Which would make think it's him that's in cahoots and using thee as a scapegoat."
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Sorlu, "Breaking a treaty would be an invitation to conflict, yes?"
</p><p>Randsford nods in agreement at Sorlu.
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Sorlu, "So perhaps we should approach this with cooler heads and open minds?"
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "Less he's just that bad at getting evidence."
</p><p>Falvicar shrugs.
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Nodyre, "Perhaps. But honoring it is an acceptance of submission."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Sorlu, "Nobody said honor it as I heard. But we need to start from a place of peace not of war."
</p><p>Roelon asks, speaking deeply to Nodyre, "It was hot heads that created ah need for the treaty aye?"
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Roelon, "I believe it was drunken mouths, actually."
</p><p>Roelon chuckles.
</p><p>Roelon nods at Nodyre.
</p><p>Randsford says, "As I advocated for the destruction of the tablet as an alternative; I see no harm in exploring all possibilities."
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Falvicar, "He's a hot head and likes to win arguments not lose. knows a blade better than words."
</p><p>Randsford shrugs.
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "But no matter what, we got each other and will protect each other."
</p><p>Elliathe says, "Well that will be nigh impossible to stop."
</p><p>Nodyre says, "Hence the needs for calm, rational negotiators."
</p><p>Aliashyrah counters, speaking to Nodyre, "Not if the &lt;treaty&gt; was entered into under duress. Should Icemule be forever subject to Vaalorian encroachment and roll over like some meek dog because of a piece of paper signed by a leader who no longer even shows her face?"
</p><p>Elliathe says, "Drunk mouths."
</p><p>You agree with Falvicar.
</p><p>Elliathe chuckles to herself.
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Falvicar, "Always."
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Nodyre, "We shall. Ta'Vaalor can offer an apology for the offense they've offered, and are to never enter our lands....and they can thus avoid war."
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Nodyre.
</p><p>You feel a small nudge on your cheek from the pearl white lizard.  The first head-butt is soon repeated by a second, and then a third when you don't immediately stop what you are doing and pay attention to the lizard.  Finally, just as you're about to turn your head to find out what the creature wants, you feel a sharp stab of pain on your ear.  It bit you!
</p><p>As you stare at the pearl white lizard in annoyance, ready to give the lizard a thorough scolding, it looks up at you with an innocent expression and makes a silly-looking little grin of sorts.  You mutter, but just can't seem to find anything stronger to say to it.
</p><p>Aenternoll shrugs.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Sorlu, "See? You're already approaching this in an aggressive manner."
</p><p>Aliashyrah glances over at you and winces.
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "If this goes south, then you and I can look for another home if it comes down to it."
</p><p>Falvicar wraps you in a tender embrace.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Our needs can be filtered to one who, aye cooler mind and tongue, kin negociate our will."
</p><p>Roelon nods at Nodyre.
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Nodyre, "We have already been met with aggression..."
</p><p>Sorlu says, "Years past."
</p><p>Aenternoll takes a drink from his Dhe'nari blood wine.
</p><p>You mutter lizards.
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement at Roelon.
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Sorlu, "Has Ta'Vaalor sent soldiers to fight us?"
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Nodyre, "They did."
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Sorlu, "Or claimed our land as their own?"
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Grutak, "When?"
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Has anyone see this treaty written down?"
</p><p>Grutak says, "They send an entire fleet of armed men to encamp around Icemule."
</p><p>Grutak says, "2 years ago."
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Nodyre, "In the past they placed soldiers here, but why would they now? We bowed down to them."
</p><p>Bakarus says, "Unfortunately the hour grows late.  I am confident in our new council and will continue to serve Icemule in any capacity needed."
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Grutak, "I said to fight us - are those soldiers here now?"
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Bakarus.
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Or was it a verbal treaty?"
</p><p>Bakarus says, "Until the next time, I wish you all Eternal Light."
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Bakarus, "A pleasant evening, Bakarus."
</p><p>Bakarus smiles.
</p><p>Grutak says, "And got Tawariel to sign a treaty allowing them to do whatever they wanted."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to you, "No, though I searched the archives in the hall. I believe it may be kept somewhere more secure."
</p><p>Aliashyrah stands up.
</p><p>Straightening her back, Aliashyrah gives a formal, low curtsy to Bakarus.  She inclines her head as well, giving Bakarus a brief nod.
</p><p>Bakarus nods respectfully.
</p><p>Bakarus says, "To you all as well."
</p><p>Randsford flashes Bakarus a wolfish grin.
</p><p>Aliashyrah settles herself comfortably in one of the leather chairs.
</p><p>Roelon takes a drink from his whiskey-spiked coffee.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Nodyre, "Had we not knuckled under we would have seen fighting yes."
</p><p>Roelon nods at Bakarus.
</p><p>Falvicar gazes in amusement at Bakarus.
</p><p>Randsford snickers.
</p><p>Bakarus's group just went through a pair of Ossian pine doors.
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Grutak, "Knuckled up? Are you mad, sir?"
</p><p>Nodyre exclaims, speaking to Grutak, "There was no conflict!"
</p><p>Grutak says, "I was there."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Not sure where you were."
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Grutak, "And was I not?"
</p><p>Aliashyrah glances appraisingly between Nodyre and Grutak.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Not if you think we weren't forced by military means."
</p><p>Elliathe whispers, "Are those two always at loggerheads like this?"
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Grutak, "Forced to do what exactly?"
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "If memory recalls right... two years ago there was a peace treaty signed."
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Nodyre, "To accept their terms."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Sorlu, "The terms of the treaty our mayor signed."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Because he was talked into it."
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Elliathe, "This is my first time witnessing their interactions so maybe?"
</p><p>Nodyre asks, "Does that matter?"
</p><p>Elliathe nods to you.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Yes it does."
</p><p>Nodyre says, "We all agree it needs to be changed."
</p><p>Sorlu says, "Under duress, or under madness, yes...she did."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Not all the facts were given to the mayor."
</p><p>Nodyre says, "But we need to be sane in our approach to this, not reckless or aggressive."
</p><p>Randsford nods in agreement at Nodyre.
</p><p>You quietly say, "I agree it needs to be changed."
</p><p>Sorlu nods to you.
</p><p>Randsford says, "We must prepare for all outcomes."
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "But I'll have to look through my journal to recall everything but I dont remember nothing about violence nor the like and am in agreement if they are talking about what I think they are talking about... then he is mad."
</p><p>Grutak says, "As I did then and will do now I will abide by the Mayors decisions."
</p><p>Sorlu agrees with Randsford.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Preferable without bloodshed."
</p><p>Grutak says, "But I will make sure he knows my mind this time."
</p><p>Aliashyrah calmly says, "Showing strength does not necessarily mean aggression."
</p><p>Nodyre laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.
</p><p>Roelon nods.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "If we sent Grutak to do this, it would mean aggression."
</p><p>Randsford says, speaking to you, "I believe we are beyond that point.  All we need to do is look to the south."
</p><p>Roelon says, speaking deeply to Randsford, "Ah do agree it is best to atleast hae ah plan in place."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Even if we never act upon it."
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "I remember a grand meeting, peaceful, and then the treaty being signed."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "Icemule currently is under the foot of Vaalor. Any negotiations approached from this current place would be as a child approaches an adult."
</p><p>Sorlu says, "In the end, the war will be left up to Ta'Vaalor. We will announce that we are free and self-governing in all ways. If Ta'Vaalor has an issue with that, we will be ready for them."
</p><p>Sorlu nods.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "Icemule needs to make it clear that she is no longer meek and willing to submit."
</p><p>Nodyre exclaims, "I suggest we let The Landing deal with The Empire for now. We can ask the Mayor to send an envoy to negotiate with Ta'Vaalor. An actual diplomat!"
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "Precisely."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "This will take strength, and resolve."
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Randsford says, speaking to Roelon, "We should rally our emissary should we not?  Believe that was your idea last tnight."
</p><p>Roelon nods at Randsford.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "If we wished to speak to Gnul, who commands the stone giants."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Send Aliashyrah."
</p><p>Randsford says, "We are stronger than we think, we have allies and there are new ones out there to be made."
</p><p>Sorlu says, "I had thought it might be nice to send Jiarine to deliver the message to Qalinor. She knows well the customs of the Elven Nations."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Grutak, "No."
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Our Ice Giant guest might be usueful."
</p><p>Grutak asks, "Why not?"
</p><p>Sorlu smirks.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking amusedly to Nodyre, "He does not like me or my comments."
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Grutak, "An Illistim elf?"
</p><p>Randsford begins chuckling at Sorlu!
</p><p>Aliashyrah clears her throat.
</p><p>Roelon grins at Sorlu.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Grutak, "Sorry, that was meant for you."
</p><p>Nodyre says, "We should send a Halfling diplomat."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Oh that'll do well."
</p><p>Falvicar peers quizzically at Roelon.
</p><p>You see Commodore Nodyre the Gambler.
He appears to be a Half-Sylvan.
He is very tall and has a lithesome, nimble build.  He appears to be time-worn.  He has piercing emerald-hued eyes and faintly lined, windburnt skin.  He has short, sandy blonde hair threaded with grey at the temples.  He has prominent biceps.
He has an ethereal kut'zikokra tattoo.
He is in good shape.
He is wearing a broad-brimmed bycocket topped with an exceptionally long snow petrel plume, a cloak, a subdued scabbard slung over his shoulder, an intricate vaalorn aegis with a crystal chamber embedded in its focus slung over his other shoulder, a duffel bag, a harness over a long-sleeved shirt, some disc armor, some vambraces, a pair of seafarer's gloves, a subdued sash, a coin pouch, an herb kit, a pair of cuffed trousers, and an unremarkable pair of boots.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Icemule isn't just halflings."
</p><p>Grutak says, "And I'd rather a smar elf than a fat halfling trying to talk sense."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Nodyre, "There is something to be said for sending an elf. Many elves still struggle under a feeling of superiority to some of the shorter lived races."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "Shorter... ha."
</p><p>Aliashyrah smirks.
</p><p>Roelon rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "I think sending you would be a mixed message."
</p><p>Roelon grins.
</p><p>Randsford says, "Sounds perfect."
</p><p>Grutak asks, speaking to Nodyre, "How so?"
</p><p>Randsford flashes a wolfish grin.
</p><p>The powerful look leaves Roelon.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Don' send me. One wrong Kilt flare and we would really be in fir it..."
</p><p>Aliashyrah laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement from Roelon.
</p><p>Deep blue motes swirl away from Roelon and fade.
</p><p>Elliathe asks, "Is not part of diplomacy understanding the culture you mean to interact with?"
</p><p>Falvicar gazes in amusement at Roelon.
</p><p>Roelon brushes a bit of dust from the folds of his black woolen kilt.
</p><p>The dull golden nimbus fades from around Roelon.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Roelon, "The Vaalorians would just bend ya over."
</p><p>Sorlu says, speaking to Nodyre, "I can understand your concerns there. But I will say this...Aliashyrah has proven herself not only to be quite loyal to Icemule, but also very eloquent in communication."
</p><p>Falvicar says, speaking to Roelon, "I'll wear a kilt and go with ye if you go."
</p><p>Falvicar snickers at Roelon.
</p><p>Roelon begins chuckling at Falvicar!
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Grutak, "She is a fairly recent arrival to our town, for one. For two, she isn't an elected representative nor an official diplomat."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Sorlu, "Loyalty is not in question."
</p><p>Roelon says, speaking deeply to Grutak, "They'd try, and leave wearin' the pink kilt."
</p><p>Roelon winks.
</p><p>Sorlu nods.
</p><p>You quietly say, "I think we need to send more than one embassary Maybe Hazlenut would be ready to go soon."
</p><p>Aliashyrah teases, speaking to Roelon, "It would not be the first war started from a man being careless with his manhood."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Nodyre and who decides if she's an official diplomat."
</p><p>Elliathe asks, speaking to Nodyre, "So you suggest that those who are newer come here have lesser voice or input?"
</p><p>Grutak asks, speaking to Aliashyrah, "Ar eyou a citizen of Icemule?"
</p><p>Sorlu laughs at Aliashyrah!
</p><p>Roelon grins at Aliashyrah.
</p><p><b>Nodyre says, speaking to you, "Hazelnut is a great suggestion."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods at Grutak.
</p><p>You quietly say, "I hear he's not in jeopardy of being a Vampire."
</p><p>Aliashyrah confirms, speaking to Grutak, "I am."
</p><p>Randsford says, speaking to you, "Best not to push Hazelnut just yet.  No knowing what will happen after being in Barlan's keep."
</p><p>Nodyre asks, speaking to Elliathe, "Is that what I said?"
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Elliathe, "No."
</p><p>Grutak asks, speaking to Nodyre, "So your saying some citizens are better than others becdause of how long they've been here?"
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Elliathe, "I suggested this individual, an Illistim elf who recently arrived in town, is not the best candidate."
</p><p>Aliashyrah smiles at Nodyre.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Grutak, "I believe I suggested a halfling diplomat be sent, sir."
</p><p>Nodyre says, "And Hazelnut is a perfect candidate."
</p><p>Grutak asks, "WHy a halfling?"
</p><p>Elliathe asks, speaking to Nodyre, "Is it not inferred when referencing that her being newer to the town is a reason not to chose her?"
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Nodyre, "You did not say it explicitly, but you use my more recent arrival as a  mark against me."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Grutak, "They are the settlers of this town and the majority of the population."
</p><p>Randsford says, speaking to Nodyre, "Halfling escorted by an elf?  Perhaps its best to send multiple races since thats who we are versus them."
</p><p>Randsford shrugs at Nodyre.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in agreement at Elliathe.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "It's not a mark unless you see it that way. It's simply a fact."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Ah, so a quota thing."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Grutak, "If that's your interpration, warmonger."
</p><p>Nodyre winks at Grutak.
</p><p>Roelon grins.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Apt discription."
</p><p>Grutak nods.
</p><p>Aliashyrah mentions, speaking calmly to Nodyre, "A fact that you highlighted as part of your objection."
</p><p>Grutak says, "I do believe in war."
</p><p>Grutak says, "And in the proper time and place."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "Indeed I did."
</p><p>Roelon takes a drink from his whiskey-spiked coffee.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "That is all that her ladyship was saying."
</p><p>Nodyre says, "But clearly Hazelnut has the diplomatic credentials for this mission. He was the one who parlayed with the Ice Giants."
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods at Elliathe.
</p><p>You quietly say, "'Well I hope we can avoid war as much as possible..."
</p><p>Grutak says, "And ended up almost dead in Moonsedge."
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "As do I, Darling... as do I."
</p><p>Elliathe nods in agreement to you.
</p><p>Falvicar nods in agreement to you.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in agreement to you.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Grutak, "A lot of people almost died in Moonsedge."
</p><p>Nodyre chuckles.
</p><p>Roelon nods once.
</p><p>Nodyre says, "Not me, of course."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to you, "Despite what people think, I never want a war.  I will never back down from one either."
</p><p>Elliathe gazes heavenward.
</p><p>Falvicar gazes in amusement at Nodyre.
</p><p>Nodyre winks at Falvicar.
</p><p>Randsford says, "We will come to no consensus tonight.  I believe the council has the information they need.  I trust them to decide along with Talliver on our best course of action."
</p><p>Randsford nods firmly.
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Grutak, "If it comes to our door step we will defend."
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in agreement at Randsford.
</p><p>Aliashyrah smiles at you.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to you, "Better to fight it on their doorstep than ours."
</p><p>Nodyre gazes heavenward.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Unless you prefer to see dead halfling children."
</p><p>Grutak shrugs.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Grutak, "Are you suggesting ... we directly attack the empire? Or Ta'Vaalor? I'm confused."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Make no mistake, war is going to happen."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Just a question of where."
</p><p>Nodyre gazes heavenward.
</p><p>Roelon slowly empties his lungs.
</p><p>Nodyre says, "Goodness gracious."
</p><p>Randsford says, speaking to Grutak, "Perhaps not at our gates but on a front we establish on the glacier.  I understand your reasoning but we must keep this town as a town; we do not need this to turn into an encampment."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to Nodyre, "I'm suggesting alot of things to the people willing to listen.  You are not one of those."
</p><p>Grutak says, "You have a closed mind."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "I believe that much can be accomplished with words. I do not see anyone suggesting Icemule march on Ta'Vaalor, only that she stand boldly and take back what is rightfully hers, which is the pride and autonomy that Vaalor tried to strip from her."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Or I'd of made my suggestions to you directly."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Grutak, "I think the Mayor is going to wind up seeing things my way."
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Aliashyrah, "It sure sounded like Grutak suggested that."
</p><p>Nodyre chuckles.
</p><p>Roelon deeply says, "Now, ah do believe our official meeting is ended. Do continue if ye wish.  However, perhaps we mull things over instead."
</p><p>Roelon stands up.
</p><p>Randsford whispers something to Roelon.
</p><p>Nodyre nods at Roelon.
</p><p>Falvicar whispers, "I would rather us be deending than be the one agressor in this case."
</p><p>Nodyre suddenly stands, his cloak billowing up with the movement.
</p><p>Grutak says, "I need to find Falvicar."
</p><p>Nodyre points at Falvicar.
</p><p>Roelon nods slowly at Randsford.
</p><p>Nodyre says, speaking to Grutak, "You found him."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, speaking to Nodyre, "He is a warrior. He thinks in blood and death. It is how he has had to learn to view the world. He returned to this room and sat calmly."
</p><p>Falvicar gazes in amusement at Nodyre.
</p><p>Grutak asks, speaking to Falvicar, "Ready?"
</p><p>You quietly say, "Thank you everyone for attending."
</p><p>You quietly say, "I hope you all have a lovely evening."
