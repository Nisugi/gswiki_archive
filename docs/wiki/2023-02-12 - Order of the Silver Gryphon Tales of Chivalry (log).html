<p>Note: This log has been edited for brevity to allow the focus to be on the presenters.

<pre style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 2em; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 7px 10px; background: #f3f3f9; border: line; text-align: left; font-size:95%; font-family: Consolas, DejaVu sans mono, Courier New, monospace; color: black; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap;"><span style="color:red">Guarrin clearly continues, "Tonight we will hear several tales of chivalry. Each of these tales will be judged by our panel of members of the Order. More on that in a moment." </span>

<span style="color:red">Guarrin casually glances at a carved oak mantel.</span>

Cryheart taps an ivory marble reliquary on a carved oak mantel.

<span style="color:red">Guarrin notes, "You can see Lord Drung's greatsword on the mantel. Along with a small reliquary for our chaplain." </span>

Tikba gazes thoughtfully at an ivory marble reliquary on a carved oak mantel

<span style="color:red">Guarrin clearly states, "Our judges will evaluate the presentation, content, and creativity for each performance. Contestants have five minutes to share their tales. Although, we do not penalize for going over the time limit.</span>

Guarrin nods appreciatively.

<span style="color:red">Guarrin says, "This is the last call for those who wish to participate tonight." </span>

<span style="color:red">Guarrin says, "Please let me know now if you have not done so yet." </span>

<span style="color:red">Guarrin says, "Alright. I am very pleased with our list of presenters, I am certain we will be entertained and perhaps learn a bit about the Code as well." </span>

<span style="color:red">Guarrin says, "We will give the presenters a moment to gather their thoughts. Tonight we will hear from Alosaka, Meril, Jisandra and Delindra and Nyaria." </span>

<span style="color:red">Guarrin says, "Let's give Alosaka a warm welcome." </span>

Alosaka grins.

Guarrin applauds politely.

Perigourd applauds.

Evia applauds Alosaka.

Lylia applauds Alosaka.

<span style="color:red">Guarrin says, "The floor is yours." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka nods appreciatively. </span>

Sunwu grunts at Alosaka respectfully.

Khazaann applauds Alosaka.

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "Friends, thank you. Tonight, a tale from the Tehir, regarding Mercy." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "Imagine with me, friends. Close your eyes to dream and in dreaming recall the sad tale of Finvar the Lost." </span>

<span style="color:blue">(Alosaka draws in a deep, slow breath, his eyes closed as if in slumber, and then he slowly exhales.) </span>

Kothos gazes with interest at Alosaka

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "What crime Finvar committed has been forgotten. Perhaps he walked widdershins around a god's favorite witch, or he slandered the king's concubine with faint praise." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka shrugs. </span>

Tikba grins wryly at Alosaka.

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "In those days the dead dwelled apart from the living, in a city of tombs on the desert's edge. They marched in languid lines from sepulchers to crypts, arms raised in prayers </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka gazes heavenward. </span>

<span style="color:blue">(Alosaka raises his arms high in supplication, face tilted up toward the unseen sun, basking in its unfelt light.) </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka reverently says, "Daily their numbers grew, and the City of the Dead swelled, lapping at its banks, threatening to overflow. In time, it might have, and all the world would flower into an open grave, forever." </span>

Kothos glances at Alosaka and shivers.

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka blinks. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka tilts his head down. </span>

Jaysehn looks thoughtfully at Alosaka.

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka reverently says, "But..." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "The gods punished Finvar with a task: patrol the border of the City of the Dead. Tend the graveblossom trees that limn its margins. Maintain forever the boundary between life and death." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka removes a fire pearl inset ora stickpin from in his grey frieze coat. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka put a fire pearl inset ora stickpin in his ivory satchel. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka just grabbed a wooden stick from the sticks. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka nods. </span>

<span style="color:blue">(Alosaka leans forward, bending at the waist, and touches the tip of his charred stick to the marble floor to trace an ashen black line across it.)</span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka tosses some wood into the fire and watches as the flames leap higher. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka nods. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka leans back. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka quietly says, "And for centuries he did. Daily he walked the border of life and death, tending the thousand graveblossom trees that marked the border of the City of the Dead." </span>

Delindra gazes with interest at Alosaka.

Tikba nods thoughtfully at Alosaka.

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka admiringly says, "He watered them with elegies and blood. Fluted caryatid trunks, bark-wreathed effigies of the dead, holding their canopies aloft with a hundred branching hands." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka turns around. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "One day, on his rounds, he found a weeping figure at the city's gates, and recognizing her, he cried, 'Lorminstra, why are you weeping so?'." </span>

The fire dies down a bit until it finds some fresh wood to burn.  The flames dance higher as they feast.

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "She shied away from his wretched figure, revulsion overwhelming her anguish. 'Begone, hideous wretch,' she said. 'Do not pollute my grief with your filthy presence.'." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka glances away. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka winces. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka covers his eyes with his hands. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "He shrouded his face with his hands, to shield her sensibilities. Her grief reemerged, welling up like a spring from her spirit, and she wept bitterly." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka leans forward. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "Why, he asked again." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka slowly empties his lungs. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "She answered, 'My lover has died, and now resides in your city of the dead. I can come no closer to him than these cruel graveblossom trees, and peer through their branches into the mists that conceal his soul.'." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka nods slowly. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "For that was the purpose of the trees, to demarcate the boundary between the world of the living and the city of the dead. Without them, the dead would flood back into the world, and all would be like Hades." </span>

<span style="color:blue">(Alosaka steps carefully over the ashen line drawn on the floor.)</span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "He told her this, but she knew, of course. She had only come to weep, as mortals sometimes did for the dead." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka shrugs. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "Years passed, and though he saw Lorminstra at the gates sometimes, he paid her no mind. His duty was to tend the trees, not the mortals who wept at them." </span>

<span style="color:blue">(Alosaka draws in a sharp, shuddering breath.)</span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka horrifiedly says, "And then, one day, he awoke to chaos! The City of the Dead was empty. Spirits and souls and ghosts washed across the world, wildly, deliriously free." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "He ran frantically down the graveblossom rows, searching for the break in the border. And there he found Lorminstra, dappled in the blood-red sap of a felled tree, an axe fallen at her feet." </span>

Tikba gazes with interest at Alosaka.

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka tilts his head down. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "She cradled in her arms a cloud of mist, a spirit, a long-lost lover. She pressed it against her bosom, unaware of the ruin all around." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka glances away. </span>

<span style="color:blue">A pained expression crosses Alosaka's face. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "The world was upside-down. The dead walked among the living, believing themselves still alive, and those truly alive howled for blood. 'Lorminstra,' they cried, 'what have you done? We are destroyed.'." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "The mortals agreed: Lorminstra was at fault, and must be punished. They would make her body the new graveblossom tree, her blood the mortar to reseal the broken wall. A beautiful, flower-bearing caryatid." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka slowly empties his lungs. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "Finvar said to them, 'Must we punish her? She committed this crime out of love, not hate. She is no evil than the rest of us.'." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka begs. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka turns around. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka squints. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka disgustedly says, "They sneered at him, 'Filthy Finvar, pestilent Finvar, who are you to speak of love? Go back to your tending and leave us to decide what Justice is.'." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka slowly empties his lungs. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka says, "Again he said, 'Can you not show her pity? Can you not display mercy? Must your justice be so cruel?'." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka scowls. </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka thunders, "'Begone, hideous wretch!' they cried. 'Do not pollute our justice with your filthy presence.' And that night they bound Lorminstra and bore her to the City of the Dead, to plant her as a graveblossom tree." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka softly says, "But, when they arrived..." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka leans back. </span>

Nyaria closes her eyes for a moment.

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka bewilderedly says, "The gap was sealed. A new graveblossom tree stood there, its bark dripping blood, Finvar's face carved in the trunk. He bore aloft a thousand blossoms and filled the gap, again dividing the living from the dead." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka quietly says, "For he had taken her place. The mercy they could not fathom, he delivered himself. And though he was but a tree now, locked in wood forever, they faintly perceived his graven face to smile." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka ponders. </span>

Tikba nods thoughtfully at Alosaka.

Kothos gazes at Alosaka.

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka concludes, "And the Tehir say Lorminstra took up his burden, tending to the graveblossom trees bordering the City of the Dead, repaying his mercy by guarding the City's gates, and deciding who shall pass." </span>

<span style="color:blue">Alosaka bows respectfully, his eyes fixed firmly on the ground. </span>

Cryheart applauds.

Kothos smiles at Alosaka.

Lylia places a hand over her heart.

Mourdeyan applauds.

Guarrin slowly empties his lungs.

Kothos applauds Alosaka.

Lylia applauds.

Guarrin lays his open palm across the arching symbol of two knotwork grizzly bears on his vultite brooch, his fingers curling around the vultite edges, and bows his head in a momentary display of respect.

Evia applauds.

Avalera applauds Alosaka.

Missoni applauds warmly.

Perigourd applauds.

Nyaria applauds.

Jisandra applauds Alosaka.

Phanna applauds Alosaka.

You applaud Alosaka politely.

Meril applauds Alosaka.

Guarrin applauds Alosaka.

Kilthal claps his hands.

Delindra applauds Alosaka.

Jaysehn applauds.

Raelee takes a moment to observe Alosaka.

Lylia murmurs, "That was beautiful."

Oxhammer applauds Alosaka.

Phanna says, "That was a lovely tale from one of the tribes."

Alosaka sits down next to you.

<span style="color:red">Guarrin says, "Well done, Alosaka. Please give me a moment to converse with the judges."</span>

Falicor nods in agreement.

Jisandra softly murmurs, "Lovely."

Tikba solemnly applauds Alosaka.

Lehon applauds.

Speaking to Alosaka, Kothos says, "You never fail to surprise me."

Alosaka ducks his head.

Speaking quietly to Alosaka, Kothos says, "That was quite intense.  Thank you for sharing."

You smile at Alosaka.

Evia put a white ceramic cup in her ruby-buttoned pack.

Archious applauds.

Kothos gives Delindra a lingering kiss on the hand.

Alosaka smiles.

<span style="color:red">Guarrin says, "Right. Thank you again Alosaka."</span>

<span style="color:red">Guarrin says, "Meril, you are up next."</span>

Meril nods at Guarrin.

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Meril, Guarrin says, "You have the floor."</span>

Alosaka turns to face Meril.

Guarrin nods encouragingly at Meril.

Meril stands up.

Jisandra gazes with interest at Meril.

Tikba turns to face Meril.

Guarrin applauds Meril.

You take a moment to observe everything you can about Meril.

Khazaann turns an inquisitive ear toward Meril.

<span style="color:green">Meril begins, "Well, I am glad to be here this evening, and I have a tale of mercy to share as well, though perhaps not as artful or as blasphemous as the last." </span>

You nod in agreement at Alosaka.

Guarrin appears to be trying hard not to grin.

<span style="color:green">Meril ponders. </span>

Alosaka stares off into space.

<span style="color:green">Meril says, "In any case, it is an old sylvan tale, and I was reminded of it when passing through Oire."</span>

Alosaka chuckles.

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "Long ago, when darkness had not yet fallen on the land, a herd of wild roltons dwelled on the grassy slopes of the Dragonspine Mountains. They were not like the fluffy white roltons of Oire, no, these had deep brown coats for the winter and could climb the high slope with skill. But they still had the minds of roltons familiar to us."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "A young huntress from a nearby sylvan encampment would often make her way up the slopes to approach the herd. They were mistrustful at first, like many wild creatures, but she learned to soothe them with the sound of her voice and the music of ringing bells. The roltons gradually allowed her into their midst, and in time they would even let her collect some of the wool they shed in the warmer seasons."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril raises her delicate silver bells up above her head and begins to softly shake them.  The finely tuned bells each bear their own unique sound and form a soft and pleasing melody. </span>

Alosaka turns an inquisitive ear toward Meril.

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "One day, the huntress noticed that the roltons were especially skittish. Even when she rang her silver bells for them, they still shied away, milling about in consternation. Perplexed, she followed the herd from a distance as they trotted up the mountain path."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites:

    "Suddenly, out of the afternoon shade, from behind a rocky formation, a great grey wolf leapt down behind the herd. The startled roltons scattered, trying to make their way forward up the mountain, but some of them were trailing behind and the wolf was quickly almost upon them. In a moment of desperate decision, the huntress loosed an arrow towards the wolf, hoping to distract it."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril throws her head back and howls, sounding something like a wolf! </span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "But the great wolf leapt aside, swift as the wind, and the arrow landed harmlessly behind him. Before she could nock another arrow, the wolf sprang upon the rolton at the rear of the herd, sinking his teeth into his prey, and together they hurtled down the mountain slope beyond reach."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "And the huntress had nothing better than to return home."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril tilts her head down. </span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "It was several days before she found the herd again on a mountain meadow, short a few more of their usual number. The great wolf had been picking them off one by one, and the alarmed roltons would no longer let her come close. But she stayed nearby this time, studying the rocky shapes around them, and thought of a plan."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "In the early evening, when the rocks cast long shadows over the mountain paths, she approached the herd again, ringing her silver bells for their attention."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril madly shakes her delicate silver bells back and forth, making a cacophony that could possibly wake the dead, then grins sheepishly and quiets the bells quickly. </span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "The roltons, skittish as ever, started to trot away down the nearest path. And somewhere in the shadows ahead, she saw a slight flicker behind the rocks."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "As the main herd trotted past the rocky formation, the shadows came alive as the great grey wolf sprang behind them again. The roltons ran ahead, bleating in panic, and the huntress nocked an arrow again. This time, though, she was not aiming for the wolf."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "The arrow arced high in the air, striking a small support on a rockfall trap above. Boulders of all sizes came rolling down towards the great wolf, trapped now on both sides of the path. It tried to spring away again, but slipped on the shifting ground and was smashed full on by a heavy boulder. Yelping in pain, the wolf continued to slide down the slope into the ravine below."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "It was some time before the huntress found the great wolf lying on its side at the bottom of the ravine, breathing raggedly with blood all over its pelt. It paid her little attention as she stood over its prone body."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites:

    "She could end it now, she thought. It would be a mercy."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "The wolf turned its head to her then, too weak to move otherwise, and stared at her with baleful red eyes."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril takes a deep breath. </span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "She made a small depression by the wolf and poured water into it. As the wolf licked at the water, she took some of the herbs she had brought in her pack, and used them as a poultice for its wounds. It was not able to fight her, until at last the night fell and it drifted off to a fitful sleep."</span>
	
<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "The wolf lay there for another day as the huntress stood watch nearby, only approaching the wolf to offer more water. It stirred when she came closer, growling, but drank the water that was offered. When it slept again, it seemed to breathe a little easier."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril closes her eyes for a moment.</span> 

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "From this day on, I will always be your enemy, she thought she heard the wolf say, somewhere deep in her mind. Its eyes were the same baleful red, and the hatred in them never wavered."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites: 

    "You will, she answered. And your children will be enemies of mine, for many thousands of years. But one day, after many turnings of the moon, and when my people have moved on and a different people are encamped in the hills, one of your kind will come to them, seeking the warmth of their campfire."</span>

<span style="color:green">Meril recites:

Oxhammer turns an inquisitive ear toward Jisandra.

<span style="color:purple">Delindra slowly empties her lungs. </span>

<span style="color:purple">(Delindra steps forward, cradling her biwa close. Jisandra moves to stand next to her sister, giving her hand a comforting squeeze before Delindra speaks.) </span>

Tikba gazes with interest at Delindra.

<span style="color:purple">Delindra clearly explains, "When I first became a squire with the Gryphons, a task I was given by Sir Guarrin was to visit Kai's shrine and view the talismans there, and to think on which talisman resonated with me the most." </span>

Alosaka gazes fondly at Delindra.

You glance between Delindra and Jisandra.

<span style="color:purple">Delindra says, "While all of them hold special meaning, the one that drew me immediately was the talisman of Despair." She pauses, then continues. "This may be a surprise, given the purpose behind Cholen's order: to pursue and share Joy." </span>

Kothos gives a sidelong glance at Guarrin.

Alosaka nods slowly.

<span style="color:purple">Delindra says, "However, it is Despair that informs Joy, that we might know its counterpoint and know Joy for the treasure that it is. And it is endurance through Despair that distinguishes those who can make it through a conflict with something vital still intact - and that is Hope." </span>

<span style="color:purple">Delindra softly says, "This song is dedicated to the Lady Kasendra and the Lady Sayilla. Their Hope shines through, even though they are parted from us." </span>

Phanna reaches up with her opposite hand and places it upon her Vornavian silk armband, bowing her head slightly as she gazes downwards.

You place a hand over your heart.

<span style="color:purple">(Delindra bows her head over her biwa, fingers poised above the strings. She takes a slow breath, then begins a quiet tune, the music wending its way through air as soft as silk.) </span>

Guarrin reaches up with his opposite hand and places it upon his Vornavian silk armband, bowing his head slightly as he gazes downwards.

<span style="color:purple">(Jisandra stands utterly still as the music begins, her gaze downcast. The notes build slow and steady, until she lifts her eyes, her voice rising to join in perfect counterpoint.) </span>

<span style="color:purple">Jisandra sings softly: 

    "When the work is past, my love,

     And the toil is all done,

     Our hearts will hold you fast, my love,

     Though your story, just begun."</span>

<span style="color:purple">(Delindra keeps her eyes fixed on the strings of her instrument, the falls of her hair shielding her expression from view. Her hands move gently, coaxing forth a tune laced with strains of sorrow and hope intermingled.) </span>

<span style="color:purple">Jisandra's firewheel flower idly twists, spinning its petals like a wheel before slowing to a stop. </span>

<span style="color:purple">Jisandra sings: 

    "Worry not about your tasks, my love

     Know that we will see them through.

     The only thing we'd ask, my love,

     That our hearts you would renew."</span>

Alosaka turns an inquisitive ear toward Jisandra.

<span style="color:purple">(Delindra finally lifts her gaze from her instrument, unshed tears gleaming in her lashes. She raises her voice to sing with her sister, their voices blending in poignant harmony.) </span>

<span style="color:purple">Jisandra sings: 

    "And we dwell here in our memories,

     Every kind and cherished smile

     And we'll honor all your legacies.

     You'll be with us all the while."</span>

<span style="color:purple">Jisandra sings: 

    "And though it isn't fair, my love,

     That you were taken far too soon.

     So much more that we would share, my love,

     And now your dreams may seem all strewn."</span>

<span style="color:purple">Jisandra sings: 

    "Now your work is past, my love,

     You lay down your heavy load.

     May your soul find peace at the last, my love,

     And know our hearts, you hold."</span>

Alosaka nods rhythmically.

<span style="color:purple">(Delindra drops her gaze again, eyes closing, though her fingers continue to play, gliding effortlessly and tenderly across the biwa. Jisandra steps next to her, placing a comforting hand on her sister's shoulder as her voice lifts once more.) </span>

Kothos gazes fondly at Delindra.

<span style="color:purple">Jisandra sings: 

    "And we dwell here in our memories,

     Every kind and cherished smile

     And we'll honor all your legacies.

     You'll be with us all the while."</span>

<span style="color:purple">(Jisandra tapers off until the final words are almost a whisper. Delindra's hands slow on the biwa, then finally still, the final notes fading into profound silence.) </span>

Delindra gazes with interest at Nyaria.

<span style="color:maroon">Nyaria quietly says, "We had a very love friendship, nearly two decades." </span>

<span style="color:maroon">Nyaria quietly says, "And granted i am surely not the easiest to be around at times, but the love that man had helped pull me through some really tough times." </span>

<span style="color:maroon">Nyaria glances at a diamond-pomelled vultite greatsword inlaid with silver griffins on the blade on a carved oak mantel. </span>

<span style="color:maroon">Nyaria quietly says, "His Cryheart, was a huge part of who he was, he was so proud of that blade, and would recount how it came to him time and time again." </span>

<span style="color:maroon">Nyaria quietly says, "I... just wanted to share this with some of the people he loved the most.  and its been hard, but something i needed to do.  Was thank the Gryphons for being such a big part of Drungs life and legacy here." </span>
