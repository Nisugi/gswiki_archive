<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary">Summary</span></h2>
<p>In 5115, the Chrysanthemum Consortium proposed an expansion to the Royal Arboretum in <a href="/wiki/Ta%27Illistim.html" title="Ta'Illistim">Ta'Illistim</a> to include facilities to support further studies and research in the botanical arts and natural philosophies.  Argent Mirror Myasara Illistim invited the members of the Consortium to present on the topics of their research thus far and make requests to be considered during the planned renovation and expansion of the Arboretum.

Splendid organic lines of vaalin frame bulbous, misted glass panes that rise high overhead, culminating in an ogee formation, with many-rayed starburst chandeliers dangling at the peak.  Mistydeep riverstones encircle a shallow pool filled with lily pads, while a central seating area with blued wrought iron tables and chairs filters out into mossy, slate paths curving around the clumping lasimor specimen.  Whorl-spindled balustrades line a short series of steps toward the stained glass doors inset with a pair of pavonated peacocks leading back inside the keep.  You also see a sapphire-eyed silvered arctic fox, a pale-eyed shadowy black cat, the blackened silver Ferghal disk and the gauze-bound Missandai disk streaked with crimson bloodstains.
Also here: Loremaster Rohese, Ferghal, Lady Missandai, Botanist Vanathys
Obvious exits: north
Vanathys says, "Good afternoon."
Rohese smiles.
Vanathys glances around the room.
Rohese wrinkles her nose.
Speaking in Elven, Missandai says, "Good afternoon."
Ferghal leans softly against Missandai.
Missandai softly chants an incantation in Sylvan as a faint crimson-hued mist surrounds her...
Missandai concentrates.
Missandai's abdomen looks better.
Arenglae suddenly fades into view.
Vanathys mutters, "I see my students have not made it yet."
&gt;
You see Botanist Vanathys.
He appears to be a Vaalor Elf.
He is taller than average and has a lean, athletic physique.  He appears to have come of age.  He has darkly lined, almond-shaped indigo eyes and golden bronze skin.  He has long, sun-kissed sandy blonde hair twisted into a loose, disheveled bun, with wavy strands escaping to frame his face.  He has a gently angled face, a slim, upturned nose and a well-defined jawline.  Two small scars cut through the pale arch of his right eyebrow.
He is in good shape.
He is wearing an unknotted ramie linen scarf, a hip-length taupe suede jacket laced up the sleeves to the elbows, a juniper green silk tunic patterned in devore foliage, some pale cheveril gloves with suede-reinforced palms, a rectangular brushed nubuck kit, some slim cocoa leather pants, and a pair of cire leather boots lightly caked with soil.
Rohese smiles at Arenglae.
&gt;pond vana
You ponder the meaning of Vanathys's existence.
Straightening her back, Arenglae gives a formal, low curtsy.  She inclines her head as well, giving a brief nod.
&gt;
Speaking curiously to Vanathys, you ask, "Students?"

You smile at Arenglae.
Rohese inclines her head.
Bakarus just arrived.
Bakarus says, "Ahh."
Bakarus smiles.
&gt;
The fox slinks around you, sniffing and eyeing your belongings and hands as she licks at her chops.  Obviously, she's expecting some kind of handout!
You nod to Missandai in greeting.
Vanathys nods to you.
Vhaelynia wanders in.

You see Bakarus Klysus the Pilgrim.
He appears to be a Human from Jantalar.
He is average height.  He appears to be very young.  He has piercing emerald green eyes and pale skin.  He has shoulder length, wavy black hair.  He has a gaunt, severely angled face, a classical nose and broad shoulders.  The fingertips of one hand are twisted and black, with a texture like corpseflesh.
His pupils slowly begin to constrict into thin vertical slits, returning to normal after a quick blink.
He is in good shape.
Gangrenous flesh lays open to expose the blackened bone of his ring finger where a smooth bone ring pierced by tiny crystal shards rests.  Sickly green necrosis spreads to the back of his hand and wrist, while blistering sores ooze along his arm.
Enshrouded as he is within a heavy pale viridian cloak, naught else of his attire can be seen.
Arenglae greets, "Pleasant afternoon."
Bakarus says, "Eternal Light, all."
Missandai nods to you in greeting.
Bakarus nods in greeting at Arenglae.
&gt;
You see Lady Missandai Brindlebrook.
She appears to be a Sylvankind of the Lassaran D'ahranal.
She is average height and has a curvaceous figure.  She appears to be very young.  She has voluminously lashed glacial blue eyes and soft, creamy white skin.  She has mid back-length, cascading chocolate hair parted to the side and pinned back with a black floral lace fascinator with a chain-linked bunny-shaped emerald veil.  She has a gilt-edged ebon mask partially covering her face and delicately arched eyebrows.  Dainty but sharp fae-like features dominate her face.  She has lustrous blood red lacquer brushed onto her perfectly manicured fingernails.
She has a pair of tiny gleaming vaalin corkscrews adorned with a bunny-shaped emerald set along the slender tips of her pointed ears, an inked stylized wisp of green smoke on her arm, some tattooed bunny pawprints on her neck, and an emerald-eyed frisky red bunny tattoo on her thigh.
A tiny quartet of silver-winged faeries dart to and fro across her form, peeking into containers and giggling as they disappear in a flurry of multicolored lights.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing a wide pointed pale vaalin collar, an ebon and jade chiffon surcoat adorned with onyx droplets, an emerald-dyed chainsil bliaut bound by a girdle of lacquered jade silk vinework, a delicate pointed pale vaalin wristlet, some jade wool stockings caught with small silken tassels under a pair of ebon silk calf-laced sandals.

Rohese fondly says, "Hello Kori."
Speaking to you, Vanathys says, "I tutor a few students in the botanical arts."
Rohese pets a sapphire-eyed silvered arctic fox.
Missandai nods to Rohese in greeting.
Speaking to Vanathys, Vhaelynia exclaims, "Professor!"
The silvered arctic fox barks at Rohese.
&gt;
You smile.
Arenglae walks over to the chairs and settles down.
Rohese smiles at Missandai.
Vhaelynia winks at Vanathys.
Vanathys glances at Vhaelynia.
&gt;

Arenglae pours herself a gilded crystal goblet.
Speaking to Vanathys, you say, "I look forward to meeting them."
&gt;

You see Vhaelynia the Apprentice in the Botanical Arts.
She appears to be a Half-Elf from Ta'Nalfein.
She is petite.  She appears to be very young.  She has silver-stippled blue-green eyes and lily white skin.  She has shoulder-length, tousled midnight black hair streaked with ivy greens and rose reds.  She has a heart-shaped face, a pert nose and softly pointed ears.
She has a jade-limned ebon rose on her wrist.
She is in good shape.
She is holding a battered leather journal in her right hand and a fluffy owl feather quill in her left hand.
She is wearing an atrous velvet cloak lined with vine-worked gold satin, a flowing ivory silk shirt with blackworked roses, a tiny arathiel rose, a series of vine-worked gold and jade bangles, a battered leather satchel embossed with intricate displays of flora, an artfully tattered midnight black velvet skirt with alternating strips of jade silk, and some knee-high ebon leather boots.
Vanathys says, "Well, there is one of them."
The shadowy black cat licks its left paw, seemingly oblivious to the world around it.
Vhaelynia says, "I've been studying in Kraken's Fall, but I took a ship back for this."
Rohese agrees with you.
Vanathys nods at Vhaelynia.
&gt;nod greet vhae
You nod in greeting at Vhaelynia.
Vhaelynia says, "I saw dolphins."
Meril just arrived.
Speaking to Vhaelynia, Vanathys says, "I'm glad my letter got there in time and you were able to pull yourself out of the many taverns."
Vhaelynia says, "It was a glorious voyage."
Tilting her aquiline head to one side, the fox's jaw drops, and her ears prick forward as if with amusement.
&gt;
Lady Ysaeril just arrived.
Speaking to herself, Vhaelynia says, "So.  Many.  Taverns."
&gt;

You chuckle to yourself.
Vhaelynia sighs happily.
Bakarus grins wryly.
Ysaeril curtsies politely.
Rohese softly says, "Welcome to Ta'Illistim, I hope you find our presentations worth the journey."
Rohese wrinkles her nose.
Rohese beams at Ysaeril, her eyes filled with delight!
&gt;
You smile at Ysaeril.
Straightening her back, Rohese gives a formal, low curtsy to Ysaeril.  She inclines her head as well, giving Ysaeril a brief nod.

You see Lady Ysaeril Illistim.
She appears to be an Elf.
She is of a middling height and has a slender build.  She appears to be youthful.  She has long-lashed vibrant violet eyes and fair skin.  She has long, shiny pale blonde hair worn neat and loose beneath the gentle drape of a triple-stranded vaalin geldaralad suspending a clouded maize-colored citrine at the brow.  She has a delicate face, a small nose and a narrow chin that matches the cleft between her slender clavicles.
She has some small silver rings each adorned with a sprig of tiny auroral starflowers set along the slender tips of her pointed ears.
A scintillating grid of silver and gold energy glows brightly beneath her.
She is in good shape.
She is holding an aged leather compass-clasped notebook in her right hand and an onyx-dipped swan feather quill in her left hand.
She is wearing some uneven glaesine filaments bearing a beryl green crystal-filled geode cluster, a pewter marbrinus dolman accented with orphrey, a subtly creweled kirtle of rime-swept lilac paeline, and a pair of dove grey leather slippers on low tapered heels.

"HAAAALP!  HAAAALP!  HAAALP!" screams a brilliant blue peacock, his color a stark contrast to the blood red hue of his lasimor perch.

[Ta'Illistim Keep, Solarium]
Splendid organic lines of vaalin frame bulbous, misted glass panes that rise high overhead, culminating in an ogee formation, with many-rayed starburst chandeliers dangling at the peak.  Mistydeep riverstones encircle a shallow pool filled with lily pads, while a central seating area with blued wrought iron tables and chairs filters out into mossy, slate paths curving around the clumping lasimor specimen.

You also see a sapphire-eyed silvered arctic fox, a pale-eyed shadowy black cat, the blackened silver Ferghal disk and the gauze-bound Missandai disk streaked with crimson bloodstains.
Also here: Lady Ysaeril, Meril, Bakarus, Loremaster Rohese, Lady Arenglae who is sitting, Ferghal, Lady Missandai, Botanist Vanathys, Vhaelynia
Obvious exits: north

Meril clasps her hands in a reverent gesture.
The light of the starburst chandelier gutters as the flames wane, brilliant hues turning dull, almost smoky.
Meril nods to Rohese in greeting.
Missandai blinks.
Rohese smiles at Meril.
Vanathys squints.
Curator Zenlynn just arrived.
Bakarus glances around the room.
Ferghal sighs.
Vhaelynia says, "It's lovely to be back, and anything about botany is exciting to me."
Zenlynn carefully places a polished linden stand on the floor.
Rohese nods in greeting at Zenlynn.
Vhaelynia says, "I came prepared to take notes."
Zenlynn says, "I think someone needed this."
Vhaelynia taps a battered leather journal, which is in her right hand.
Lucrecea just arrived.

You see Curator Zenlynn Veythorne Illistim the Dedicated of Lore.
She appears to be an Elf.
She is shorter than average.  She appears to have come of age.  She has almond-shaped blue-green eyes and alabaster skin.  She has waist length, glossy copper red hair streaked with silver.  She has a dainty face, a small nose and slightly pointed ears.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing a dark heather silk blouse with oval jet buttons, a pair of leather gloves, a pair of dark linen pants, and a pair of sturdy leather boots.

Rohese smiles at Lucrecea.
Lucrecea smiles.

You smile at Zenlynn.
Her hand lowered, Rohese gives Lucrecea a subtle wave.
Vanathys nods at Vhaelynia.
Lucrecea waves.
Zenlynn taps a polished linden stand.
A seed-eyed dusky-grained glowbark mandrake toddles into the area and up to Lucrecea.
Arenglae smiles faintly at Zenlynn.
Bakarus just opened a jagged finger bone reliquary.
Bakarus removes a stygian valravn quill from in his finger bone reliquary.
Speaking to Vhaelynia, Vanathys asks, "Did you bring any of the others?"
Rohese clears her throat.
Speaking graciously to Zenlynn, you say, "My thanks."
Her hand lowered, Arenglae gives Lucrecea a subtle wave.
&gt;nod elae
You incline your head.
Lucrecea lightly greets, "Good afternoon."
Ysaeril carefully tucks her swan feather quill behind one ear.

You see Lucrecea Ruin the Architect of the Aerie.
She appears to be an Ardenai Elf.
Gracing her brow is a slender vaalin geldaralad, the band created from delicately woven links.  A teardrop of darkened garnet dangles from the geldaralad on a thin chain and is centered precisely on her forehead.
She is of a slight height and has a svelte figure.  She appears to be youthful.  She has slightly canted vibrant mulberry-hued eyes and smoothly tanned skin.  She has gentle curls of long, bronze-swept silky raven black hair held back behind the ears by a slim pair of hart antlers draped in a webwork of incarnadine arathiel baubles.  She has a delicately boned face and long, slender ears ending in thinly tapering tips.  She has bare-tipped dark russet lacquer brushed onto her gently tapered fingernails.
She has sharply tapering strokes inked in deep ebony sweeping upward from the corners of her eyes.
A fan of ethereal blades hovers high about her form, twisting and turning silently.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing a desiccated crow claw pendant clutching a smoke-swirled phial, a dusky kidskin half-circle cape, a dark leather corset cinched with tasseled ebon cords to form an hourglass figure over an off-the-shoulder blouse of scarlet and ivory bourde, some soft kidskin casting leathers dyed a dusky grey, a darkened pewter signet ring, a starched pale silk purse sculpted to form a pudgy kitten, a hemp-strung glowbark whistle decorated in dusky grains, a pair of hip-slung dark leather trousers, and some madder-hued ruched leather riding boots lofted on eahnor flame heels.
Feriae waves to Vanathys.
Zenlynn says, "You are welcome."
Arenglae gives a sidelong glance at Bakarus.

You smile at Lucrecea.
Bakarus smiles at Arenglae.
Bakarus put a stygian valravn quill in his finger bone reliquary.
Arenglae nods faintly at Bakarus.
Bakarus just closed a jagged finger bone reliquary.
Vhaelynia says, "A few of us."
Vhaelynia nods at Vanathys.
Speaking to Bakarus, Arenglae greets, "Ser."
Vhaelynia says, "A few others may have, uh, gotten sidetracked."
Speaking to Arenglae, Bakarus says, "Checking on my writing implements."
A faint silvery glow fades from around Bakarus.
Vanathys says, "Ah, there is Feriae."
Vanathys nods at Feriae.
Vhaelynia says, "The ship's captain was quite pretty."
Vhaelynia grins.
Rohese smiles.

You see Vhaelynia the Apprentice in the Botanical Arts.
She appears to be a Half-Elf from Ta'Nalfein.
She is petite.  She appears to be very young.  She has silver-stippled blue-green eyes and lily white skin.  She has shoulder-length, tousled midnight black hair streaked with ivy greens and rose reds.  She has a heart-shaped face, a pert nose and softly pointed ears.
She has a jade-limned ebon rose on her wrist.
She is in good shape.
She is holding a battered leather journal in her right hand and a fluffy owl feather quill in her left hand.
She is wearing an atrous velvet cloak lined with vine-worked gold satin, a flowing ivory silk shirt with blackworked roses, a tiny arathiel rose, a series of vine-worked gold and jade bangles, a battered leather satchel embossed with intricate displays of flora, an artfully tattered midnight black velvet skirt with alternating strips of jade silk, and some knee-high ebon leather boots.
Arenglae nods faintly at Bakarus.
Arenglae takes a drink from her crystal goblet.
Arenglae looks rather relaxed.

Speaking to Vhaelynia, Vanathys asks, "Did this one stop at the docks?"
I could not find what you were referring to.
&gt;l fer
You see Student Feriae.
She appears to be an Elf.
She is short and has a lithe build.  She appears to be very young.  She has gilt-flecked lapis blue eyes and pale skin.  She has side-shaven, silken blue-green hair teased at the crown, the remaining length pulled into a high bun by a carved lasimor quill.  She has an angular face and a freckled nose.  Tiny vert-colored leaves have been inked across her high cheekbones.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing a chain-strung brass compass, a rivet-reinforced hunter green wool robe pinned along the high-to-low hem, a shoulder-slit natural linen shirt bound with a quartet of leather belts, an aged leather-set vasculum, a pair of cross-strapped coppery wool leggings striped in teal, and some thigh-high boots crafted from sepia-colored rawhide.
Vanathys appears to be trying hard not to grin.
Feriae glances down.
Speaking to Vhaelynia, Missandai says, "That is always a plus."
Rohese folds her hands.
Speaking to Vanathys, Vhaelynia says, "Yes!  It was much easier."
Vhaelynia nods at Missandai.

Myasara just arrived.
Speaking excitedly to Vanathys, Feriae says, "We even got to use the gangplank."

You chuckle to yourself.
Vanathys nods approvingly at Feriae.
Missandai laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.
With a graceful movement of her hands, Ysaeril lowers her head and sinks into a formal curtsy before Myasara.
Missandai leans softly against Ferghal.
You murmur, "A small measure better than swimming, I should think."
Vhaelynia curtsies to Myasara.
Myasara nods.
Myasara says, "Good day."

You see Student Feriae.
She appears to be an Elf.
She is short and has a lithe build.  She appears to be very young.  She has gilt-flecked lapis blue eyes and pale skin.

Missandai curtsies politely to Myasara.

A thin layer of stone covers Ferghal's form and undulates with his motions.
You see Ferghal Naer'shazbanon the Master of the Order of Voln.
He appears to be a Dark Elf.
He is taller than average.  He appears to be mature.  He has gold-flecked violet eyes and ebon skin.  He has very long, flowing white hair with a black streak running through it.  He has an angular face, an aquiline nose and a generous mouth.  He has a six-stemmed snapdragon with a mane of clustered leaves sitting on his shoulder.
He has a vaalin-swept soulstone ring in his lip.
He is in good shape.
He is wearing a shadowy black wraithaline medallion carved with runes, an ash doeskin neck sheath exposing the hilt of a vultite knife, a cobweb-covered jet black spidersilk cloak edged with silver silk trim, a Crafters of Elanthia insignia, a polychromatic crowstone fetish bound in tri-color wire, a wisp-formed chrysoprase symbol caged in scarlet despanal, an ebon-hued obsidian gate pin, a dark crimson leather satchel with a gold clasp slung over his shoulder, a knitting supply tote slung over his other shoulder, a mithglin-framed eisenruck with ebon suede panels, a four-buttoned onyx leather waistcoat over a faint-sheened kohl black silk shirt, some ensigiled casting leathers, a limbless kitten skeleton bracelet, a dark leather cuff inset with mithril vines and topped by a full-petaled azurite rosette, a ko'nag-framed mithril tackle box with a red bunny-shaped latch, a bamboo-shaped gold vasculum, a crimson silk drawstring gem pouch shot through with elaborate blackworking, some fitted pants of well-oiled black leather, and some low cut dark sable boots.

Speaking respectfully to Myasara, Rohese greets, "Argent Mirror, we are honoured."
Rohese inclines her head.
Speaking to Arenglae, Bakarus asks, "Have you long held interest in the botanical sciences?"

Bakarus nods respectfully at Myasara.

Meril gazes about with serene contemplation, then gracefully crosses her hands across her leather and executes a gentle bow.

Ferghal bows to Myasara.

Arenglae stands up.

Straightening her back, Arenglae gives a formal, low curtsy to Myasara.  She inclines her head as well, giving Myasara a brief nod.

Myasara says, "I have been looking forward to this."

Rohese smiles.

Vanathys smiles.

Speaking sheepishly to Myasara, Rohese admits, "Do forgive me, I am a little nervous."

Rohese glances around the room.

Vanathys allows, "You did seem to show an interest in the botanical arts during the festival a few months back."

Bakarus nods understandingly.

Rohese nods in greeting at Alisaire.

Night follows in Alisaire's wake, suffusing the surroundings in dusky twilight.

Alisaire inclines her head.

You gaze with interest at your surroundings.

Myasara smiles.

Alisaire mildly says, "Good evening."

Hopping out from beneath the foliage, the spotted throat of a hermit thrush flashes in the distance as it trills a haunting whisper-song that echoes across the solarium.

Ysaeril smiles at Alisaire.

Bakarus nods respectfully at Alisaire.

Bakarus says, "Eternal Light."

You quietly whisper to Rohese, "Do not be nervous, you are a consummate scholar."

You smile at Rohese.

Rohese blushes a rosy pink shade at you.

Rohese demurely lowers her misty grey eyes.

Myasara walks over to the chairs and settles down.

Zenlynn nods at Myasara.

The silvered arctic fox scampers about and pants with wriggling excitement, springing closer to you and then darting away in a gracefully exuberant game of one-sided tag.

Rohese whispers something to Zenlynn.

Rohese smiles at Zenlynn.

Lucrecea sits down next to Arenglae.

Ysaeril walks over to the chairs and settles down.

Lucrecea adopts an agreeable expression.

You see Lucrecea Ruin the Architect of the Aerie.
She appears to be an Ardenai Elf.
Gracing her brow is a slender vaalin geldaralad, the band created from delicately woven links.  A teardrop of darkened garnet dangles from the geldaralad on a thin chain and is centered precisely on her forehead.
She is of a slight height and has a svelte figure.  She appears to be youthful.  She has slightly canted vibrant mulberry-hued eyes and smoothly tanned skin.  She has gentle curls of long, bronze-swept silky raven black hair held back behind the ears by a slim pair of hart antlers draped in a webwork of incarnadine arathiel baubles.  She has a delicately boned face and long, slender ears ending in thinly tapering tips.  She has bare-tipped dark russet lacquer brushed onto her gently tapered fingernails.
She has sharply tapering strokes inked in deep ebony sweeping upward from the corners of her eyes.
A fan of ethereal blades hovers high about her form, twisting and turning silently.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing a desiccated crow claw pendant clutching a smoke-swirled phial, a dusky kidskin half-circle cape, a dark leather corset cinched with tasseled ebon cords to form an hourglass figure over an off-the-shoulder blouse of scarlet and ivory bourde, some soft kidskin casting leathers dyed a dusky grey, a darkened pewter signet ring, a starched pale silk purse sculpted to form a pudgy kitten, a hemp-strung glowbark whistle decorated in dusky grains, a pair of hip-slung dark leather trousers, and some madder-hued ruched leather riding boots lofted on eahnor flame heels.

You see Lady Ysaeril Illistim.
She appears to be an Elf.
She is of a middling height and has a slender build.  She appears to be youthful.  She has long-lashed vibrant violet eyes and fair skin.  She has long, shiny pale blonde hair worn neat and loose beneath the gentle drape of a triple-stranded vaalin geldaralad suspending a clouded maize-colored citrine at the brow.  She has a delicate face, a small nose and a narrow chin that matches the cleft between her slender clavicles.
She has some small silver rings each adorned with a sprig of tiny auroral starflowers set along the slender tips of her pointed ears.
A scintillating grid of silver and gold energy glows brightly beneath her.
She is in good shape.
She is holding an aged leather compass-clasped notebook in her right hand.
She is wearing some uneven glaesine filaments bearing a beryl green crystal-filled geode cluster, a pewter marbrinus dolman accented with orphrey, a subtly creweled kirtle of rime-swept lilac paeline, and a pair of dove grey leather slippers on low tapered heels.
Arenglae smiles faintly at Lucrecea.
Rohese gently brushes her cool silver hair away from her eyes and, with a deft twist of her wrist, tucks it back into its bindings.
Meril walks over to the chairs and settles down.
Speaking to Arenglae, Lucrecea whispers aloud, "I've been looking forward to this."

You see Loremaster Rohese Bayvel Illistim the Scrivener of Ta'Illistim.
She appears to be an Elf.
She is taller than average with a slender willowy form.  She appears to be of a tender age.  She has silver-lashed misty grey eyes and preternaturally pale skin.  She has lustrous, cool silver hair woven into a complex latticework of thin looping braids down her back and secured by a thin gold wirework circlet with calligraphic curls.  She has slender ears peeking through her hair that taper to fine points.  Her composed expression has a sense of scholarly authority despite her youthful, fey-like appearance.
She has an inking of a faint star constellation on her neck, and a cascade of tiny silver stars tattooed over her right eyebrow that fades into her hairline.
She has occasional faint traces of text flowing beneath her visible skin.
She is in good shape.
She is holding a moth-embossed almond suede folio in her left hand.
She is wearing a densely piled perse fur wrap falling from the right shoulder, a scattering of golden aragless fireflies twinkling across the decollete, a trailing lush midnight velvet gown with a single floor-length pendant sleeve, an adularescent pale opal ring, a wedding band of midnight-tinted glaes trailing across the left ring finger, and a pair of gold foiled chopines with dark purple ametrine detailing.

<b>A voice calls out. "The Chrysanthemum Consortium will be giving a series of presentations on recent developments in botanical research, including a proposal to expand the Shining City's Royal Arboretum in the solarium in Ta'Illistim Keep.  It is about to begin.  All are welcome to join!"</b>
<b></b>
Speaking to Vanathys, Zenlynn says, "I am glad you could make it."

Speaking to Lucrecea, Arenglae whispers aloud, "As have I.  I am sure it will be most informative."

Zenlynn walks over to the chairs and settles down.

Vanathys nods at Zenlynn.

High Lord Mirkk just arrived.

Mirkk inclines his head.

You see High Lord Mirkk Timbertree.
He appears to be a Human from Bourth.
He is tall.  He appears to be an adult.  He has piercing dark blue-green eyes and tanned skin.  He has shoulder-length, flowing rich mahogany hair drawn back in a nape-hugging ponytail.  He has a rugged face and a broad chest.  A speckled white hawk feather quill tipped with a spiraled dark vaalin nib is tucked behind his ear.
He is in good shape.
He is wearing a resplendent violet satin cravat with a silvery peacock pattern, a knee-length grey tweed topcoat threaded with a subtle herringbone pattern, a viridian jacquard waistcoat with an elegant white feather pattern, a finespun periwinkle silk shirt fastened by a line of ivory buttons, a gold feather quill curling to form a wedding band on his left ring finger, some svelte dove grey wool trousers with charcoal black silk trim, and a pair of black granulated leather boots buckled with nielloed silver.

Speaking to Zenlynn, Vanathys says, "I would not miss such a discussion."

Myasara stands up.

Rohese beams at Mirkk, her eyes filled with delight!

Mirkk walks toward Rohese.

Vanathys says, "I brought some students, too."

Mirkk winks.

Vanathys glances between Feriae and Vhaelynia.

Mirkk takes Rohese's hand into his own.

Speaking to Rohese, Myasara asks, "If I may say a word or two?"

Feriae blushes a rosy pink hue to the tips of her ears.

Speaking fondly to Mirkk, Rohese whispers aloud, "Hello you."


[Ta'Illistim Keep, Solarium]
Flickering like stars in the night sky, several many-rayed starburst chandeliers cast a warm glow across the solarium.  Some blued wrought iron chairs are gathered around a matching table in the central seating area, with narrow paths spiraling outward amid the foliage.  Fireflies hover around a lasimor specimen near a shallow pool filled with lily pads, where the chirping song of frogs lends a gentle drone to the ambience.  Short steps leading back to the keep are illuminated by a heatless flame within each whorl-spindled baluster.  You also see a seed-eyed dusky-grained glowbark mandrake, a polished linden stand, a sapphire-eyed silvered arctic fox, a pale-eyed shadowy black cat, the blackened silver Ferghal disk and the gauze-bound Missandai disk streaked with crimson bloodstains.
Also here: High Lord Mirkk, Alisaire, Myasara, Lucrecea who is sitting, Student Feriae, Curator Zenlynn who is sitting, Lady Ysaeril who is sitting, Meril who is sitting, Bakarus, Loremaster Rohese, Lady Arenglae who is sitting, Ferghal who is sitting, Lady Missandai, Botanist Vanathys, Vhaelynia
Obvious exits: north

Myasara says, "This group of scholars that have called themselves The Chrysanthemum Consortium sent a detailed plan to me with some of their research.  I asked them here today to share it in more depth with all who are interested."

Myasara says, "Their topic is near and dear to our heart, our Arboretum."

Rohese whispers something to Mirkk.

Rohese smiles at Myasara.

Myasara says, "And without further words, I would like to turn the floor over to them."

Myasara walks over to the chairs and settles down.

Rohese smiles.

Rohese nods appreciatively at Myasara.

Vanathys sits down next to Feriae.

(Rohese lifts the hem of her lush velvet gown slightly and takes a few steps forward into the middle of the room.)

Rohese clears her throat.

Rohese warmly greets, "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us this afternoon."

With a waddling stride, a seed-eyed dusky-grained glowbark mandrake approaches a sapphire-eyed silvered arctic fox, reaching his root-like appendages out in a semblance of a greeting.  The fox gazes back at the mandrake in confusion before the little plant attempts an overexaggerated wink.

Rohese humbly introduces, "My name is Rohese Bayvel-Timbertree.  I am currently Loremaster of the Mist Harbor Library and a Scrivener of Ta'Illistim."

Rohese graciously continues, "I will let each of my esteemed colleagues introduce themselves in turn but, if you would allow me a moment of your time, I will give a brief overview of why you have been invited here today."

Rohese casually glances about, her misty grey eyes reflective pools that mirror everything around her.

Rohese smiles.

Bakarus turns an inquisitive ear toward Rohese.

Rohese softly elaborates, "The purpose of this gathering is to share a series of short presentations on developments in botanical research."

Rohese lightly asks, "Why, I here you ask?"

Rohese wrinkles her nose.

Rohese folds her hands.

Rohese softly explains, "A year ago, almost to the day, I sought a meeting with the Argent Mirror..."

Rohese nods respectfully at Myasara.

Rohese smiles.

Rohese softly continues, "...to discuss the possibility of collaborating on the refurbishment and expansion of our city's Arboretum."

Rohese softly clarifies, "I wanted to ensure that the Council of Thrones was made aware of research being carried out by notable scholars across Elanthia in the fields of botany, mycology, dendrology or phytotoxicology."

Rohese softly continues, "It occurred to me that we were in need of a place to assist with that study and where better than in an existing facility within the walls of our beloved city."

Vanathys nods approvingly.

Rohese wrinkles her nose.

Vhaelynia listens intently, making numerous notes in her journal.  From time to time, she glances at the Argent Mirror with wide eyes before turning her attention back to the speaker.

Alisaire folds her arms over her chest.

Rohese softly elaborates, "As presented, the submission incorporates initial stage architectural plans for a conservatory or greenhouse with an additional, fully equipped research facility and a repository of information to be accessible to all academics, students, and visitors."

Bakarus reaches out and touches his finger bone reliquary.

Rohese softly says, "It is our hope that, once you have heard more from some of the scholars cited in this submission, you will endorse this proposal and lend your support to our ambitious endeavour."
Rohese smiles.

Rohese glances around the room.

Rohese clears her throat.

Rohese pensively says, "Since I have the floor, I shall begin by sharing a brief insight into my own current research project."

Rohese softly begins, "Over the past few years, I have been carrying out a genealogical study of the Bayvel family and, in turn, endeavouring to locate their respective memorial trees."

Rohese nods graciously to you.

Rohese softly says, "In so doing, I became aware of a phenomena that warranted further investigation: that of their sentience."

Elaejia smiles and nods her head slightly.

Rohese rhetorically asks, "Why memorial trees?"

Rohese simply answers, "Memorials are important to the Illistimi."

Rohese nods thoughtfully at Myasara.

Myasara nods.

Rohese casually remarks, "You only have to walk the city's Weys and Vars to see an array of memorials to prominent members of Illistim society."

Rohese smiles.

Lord Teveriel just arrived.

Rohese lightly notes, "But not all of its citizens can be commemorated in quite such an ostentatious manner."

Rohese thoughtfully posits, "There has always been a spiritual link between elves and trees, and elves who are grieving find in trees an unspoken solace and a solemn comfort."

Rohese rhetorically asks, "And why is that?"

Teveriel folds his hands behind his back.

Rohese softly offers, "Because trees remember."

Rohese fiddles with the strings on her almond suede folio for a moment before opening its front flap.

Rohese removes a radiant ghostly blue leaf from in her almond suede folio.

Rohese gazes thoughtfully at her ghostly blue leaf.

Rohese softly elaborates, "Spending time with memorial trees affiliated to members of my own family, I observed that they are truly wonderful "beings" with innate adaptability and intelligence."

Rohese notes, quietly, a few salient particulars of the leaf.

Rohese softly contends, "They have the capacity to communicate; not only sharing information between themselves but with engaged observers and sometimes even casual passers-by."

Rohese smiles.

Bakarus ponders.

Rohese softly says, "They do not treat all other trees the same and have been known to either turn away or even reach out and heal a partnered tree."

Rohese softly asserts, "They develop connections - dare I say "friendships" - where they can distinguish between one individual and another."

Rohese brushes her fingers lightly against her ghostly blue leaf.

You smile at Rohese.

Rohese softly exclaims, "And I don't just mean between themselves!"

Rohese softly says, "My time spent with just a few memorial trees has revealed a startling amount of information but I believe it is merely a hint of their consciousness and cognitive ability."

Rohese gazes thoughtfully at her ghostly blue leaf.

Rohese softly says, "So, it is my hope that by closely studying the composition and nature of the foliage, I will be able to better understand this exciting discovery."

Dark colors streak across the sky, washing the city with purple and coral hues before sinking beyond the Dragonspine.

Ysaeril gazes west.

Rohese sheepishly adds, "I just hope that my husband will continue to tolerate the ever-increasing collection of leaves slowly taking over our home."

Rohese surreptitiously glances at Mirkk.

Rohese wiggles her nose.

Mirkk bites his lip.

Mirkk grins.

The shadowy black cat cleans its coat carefully.

Alisaire glances appraisingly at Mirkk.

Rohese softly concludes, "Thank you for listening and I will now hand you over to my colleague, Lady Elaejia Silithyr."

Missandai folds her hands in her lap.

Rohese nods respectfully to you.

Rohese takes a few steps back.

Lucrecea smiles at Rohese.

You stride a few steps forward.

Rohese put a radiant ghostly blue leaf in her almond suede folio.

Rohese lets out a long, contemplative breath.

Rohese smiles at Mirkk.

Vhaelynia sketches a tree in her journal, whispering to herself, "Trees equal memories."

Mirkk nods approvingly at Rohese.

Rohese wrinkles her nose.

Mirkk whispers something to Rohese.

Master Aendir just arrived.

You take a deep breath.

You smile at Aendir.

Rohese whispers something to Mirkk.

Rohese nods in greeting at Aendir.

Rohese smiles.

A smoky haze drifts through the air.

You amusedly murmur, "Just in time."

Aendir smiles.

Rohese giggles softly at you.

Aendir gives you a lingering kiss on the cheek.

You begin, "For those who do not know me, I am Elaejia Silithyr Loenthra, and have only recently relocated here from the eastern coast of Elanith.  Several years ago, I had cause to join an expedition to the Broken Lands and was immediately taken with the alien landscape, unlike any other I had seen.  If you have not visited that place, I shall paint a verbal picture of it for you first."

Alisaire nods approvingly.

Rohese inclines her head.

Bakarus nods to you.

(Elaejia stops for a moment, recollecting something.)

You remove a cerulean silk-wrapped portfolio from in your pale leather bag.

You open a cerulean silk-wrapped portfolio.

You move the contents of your portfolio about until you have them arranged in the perfect order.


Glossy cerulean silk covers the large, square-shaped portfolio with the crisp edges thickly framed in contrasting white embroidery.  The threading converges in the middle where it forms the elaborate image of a multi-tentacle anemone, accented with pieces of hammered silver along the wide trunk.  A miniature toggle of alabaster is pulled through a braided loop of vivid cobalt mithglin to keep the interior contents secured.


In the silk-wrapped portfolio:
Special [3]: an oversized off-white sheet (3)

A stamped helix of five entwined glowbark branches crests the off-white sheet serving as header over a flourished inking of some glowing green lichen.
In the Common language, it reads:

Specimen 1: Lichen, glowing green.
Description: Filamentous in form, with a varigated leprose texture.  Glowing lobes protrude at irregular intervals in living specimens.
Notes: Life can be prolonged in collected samples through provision of a combined simple sugar and mana source such as ayana jelly substrate.


A stamped helix of five entwined glowbark branches crests the off-white sheet serving as header over a flourished inking of a large black toadstool.
In the Common language, it reads:

Specimen 2: Toadstool, black.
Description: Dome-shaped black cap speckled with scales.  Stem lacks ring.  Gills black, spore imprint is ochre-colored and heavy.
Notes: Grows in great numbers on the jagged plain, particularly in concert with lichens, and also thickly around any evidence of bones.


A stamped helix of five entwined glowbark branches crests the off-white sheet serving as header over a flourished inking of some blackened moss.
In the Common language, it reads:

Specimen 3: Moss, blackened.
Description: Extremely simple in structure, slender pale green shoots rising from a matted root structure and dotted with spear-shaped lobes.  Secretes a sticky black mucilage covering all parts of the moss, giving it its color.
Notes: Inspection of sample found fog beetle eggs attached to the moss.  Living samples appear to secrete more mucilage in presence of a light source, perhaps as a protective measure.

Obvious exits: north

You put a cerulean silk-wrapped portfolio on a polished linden stand.

You elaborate, "Accessed by an old magic in a wild Sheruvian monastery, when first one arrives there, it is difficult to discern what has changed.  The chamber seems to be identical to the one before it.  However upon taking your first breath, the change becomes clear.  The air itself is bitter, nearly caustic, and the sky once you can see it, is pure darkness with no star or moon to fix your way upon."

You continue, "The landscape is blasted, a plain of jagged stone that extends far to the east from a featureless and smooth cliff.  The only features of note are a central dome and a border thicket of crystal, and a sea of boiling mud to the south.  Discounting the hostile denizens, the only notable feature of the area is its insatiable hunger for mana.  Spend enough time in that place and you will feel it testing you, lapping at your reserves."

Alisaire smiles pleasantly.

Aendir smirks at Alisaire.

Teveriel nods grimly.

You indicate the silk-wrapped portfolio as a possible option.

You briskly say, "Moving on to an abstract of my research, the flora of the Broken Lands is limited to fungi and lichens - which are in actuality a type of natural chimera.  Examined through precision lenses, ordinary lichens are formed of colonies of cooperative fungi and algae.  Teleologically speaking, mundane forms of these flora exist as the first and last stages of the natural cycle of life, death, and rebirth."

You say, "After a catastrophe such as a landslide, a wildfire, or the eruption of a volcano, lichens are the first flora to appear on the bare stones, bringing life to the barren and converting some of the minerals to soil.  Fungi as we all know take advantage of the energy released at the end of life through death and decay.  One might suppose that fungi were the first necromancers."

Bakarus nods slowly.

You give a sidelong glance at Aendir.

You bite your lip.

Aendir smirks.

You rhetorically ask, "The bookended nature of these two forms is what drew my attention to their presence in that place.  It cannot be said that any complex cycle of life exists there in a normal sense; so why then are these two, the forerunner and the reaper as it were, present at all?"

Bakarus grins.

You lecture, "Not only that, but both of these creatures are present in several varieties, including several lichens which emit luminescence.  The purposes served by glowing flora in a natural environment are typically limited to attracting or deterring herbivores, but I did not observe any such creatures in that place.  In truth, however, it was this ability that lead me down the path to my conclusions."

You posit, "So then, what is the interested researcher left with?  The unusual creatures themselves, and a land that would not otherwise seem to support a true cycle of life.  There is almost nothing present that would support even modest populations of the fauna we find there, the myklian lizards, the fog beetles, and so on.  A land lacking any sunlight or rain, that indeed seems to exist in some kind of crude stasis, and likely could not persist at all were it not for one thing: mana."

Rohese inclines her head.

Vanathys nods understandingly.

You reasonedly say, "It was in fact the aggression of the being known as a dark vortece that honed my attention to the flows of mana in that place.  Unlike more natural environments, which are threaded to varying degrees with natural mana, the Broken Lands lacks any notable mana foci, and the land all but thirsts for it."

Rohese bites her lip.

You explain, "The dark vorteces frequently strike out with an ability that taps one's own mana reserves.  And finally, and most interestingly, any attempt to investigate the crystalline structures of the Broken Lands by magical means is summarily thwarted and fully absorbed."

You authoritatively say, "So, in an environment lacking any other life-sustaining elements, we must conclude that it is the very mana itself that sustains the fungi and lichens, and thereby all other bestial denizens, of the broken lands.  I theorize that the forerunners arrived to this place, even more inhospitable that the worst devastations on Elanith, and adapted."
You assert, "Where lichens would normally thrive on sunlight, their fungal parts tapped directly into mana itself to sustain themselves, and developed the ability to create light.  Their algal parts benefitted from this light and together, they forged their path into the Broken Lands."

You continue, "Where the forerunners came, the reapers followed to complete this abbreviated life cycle, but no doubt soon adapted to take advantage of the other sources of death and decay available - the larger creatures such as myklians and fog beetles."

(Elaejia waves her hands as she speaks.)

You say, "What then, are we to do with this information?  What areas for further research should we pursue, or opportunities for advancement?  The possibilities are vast, but I shall conclude with a few suggestions."

Aendir grins.

Vanathys turns an inquisitive ear toward you.

Rohese inclines her head.

You observe, "We know from our alchemically-inclined scholars that the botanical world interacts with mana in myriad ways, most notably evidenced in the ayana plant, which only grows in strong mana foci and concentrates magical energy within itself, but does not otherwise show any inclination to put that energy to use."

Aendir gazes with interest at you.

You smile.

Rohese nods thoughtfully.

You suggest, "The opportunities afforded by these singular fungi and lichens, which convert mana to light, suggest the possibility of self-replicating technologies.  Consider the usefulness of a plant that might instead convert ambient mana to heat, or one that could alert to intruders by sensing motion."

You say, "Just a few avenues for further study - I am sure those present, and my esteemed colleagues, will soon think of other possibilities."

You graciously say, "I thank you for your attention and willingness to indulge intellectual curiosity this afternoon."

Rohese smiles.

You incline your head.

Alisaire nods approvingly to you.
Rohese nods.
Aendir applauds politely.
Bakarus applauds.
Lucrecea smiles at you.
Missandai applauds politely.
Vanathys applauds.
Feriae applauds.
Ysaeril applauds politely.
Teveriel applauds.
Vanathys whispers something to Feriae.
Mirkk applauds you.
Meril shakes her head.
Vanathys squints at Feriae.

Speaking pleasedly to you, Aendir says, "A most informative topic, and well spoken - my dear."

Feriae blinks at Vanathys.

Aendir smiles.

You say, "I shall turn the floor now to our esteemed lady Ysaeril."

Rohese warmly acknowledges, "Even more fascinating that your original brief thoughts a year ago!"

Aendir sits down next to Lucrecea.

Vhaelynia rapidly makes some final notes, whispering to herself something about the lichen, fungi, and dead man's fingers.  She belatedly claps and flushes in embarrassment.

Rohese smiles at you.

Ysaeril stands up.

Teveriel folds his hands behind his back.

You take a few steps back.

Lucrecea smiles at Aendir.

Ysaeril sashays gracefully up behind a polished linden stand.

Aendir winks at Lucrecea.

Lucrecea whispers, "That was wonderful!"

You smile at Lucrecea.

Zenlynn ponders.

Rohese pulls the flap over the top of her almond suede folio and ties it down tightly by wrapping its strings around the folio's stout metal hooks.

Myasara nods at Zenlynn.

Ysaeril lightly says, "Hello, and thank you for taking the time to consider our -- Chrysanthemum Consortium's efforts -- and my research for this project.  I am Ysaeril, Curator of Caeruil City School and Atelier."

You quietly whisper to Lucrecea, "I had hoped my musing would be interesting to you."

You gaze fondly at Aendir.

Aendir smiles.

Ysaeril clears her throat.

Mirkk whispers something to Rohese.

Rohese smiles.

Ysaeril places her hand on her compass-clasped notebook.

Ysaeril nervously reflects, "I... I am an artist, ethnobotanist too, and former handmaiden to the Argent Mirror as well.  My goal with this project is to honor, preserve, educate, and even still, discover."

Rohese smiles at Mirkk.

Lucrecea whispers, "Very much so.  Thank you for sharing it in such great detail."

Aendir gazes with interest at Ysaeril.

Mirkk whispers something to Rohese.

Mirkk bites his lip.

Ysaeril explains, "Ethnobotany is the study of how indigenous plants are utilized, the lens of those who live in the region.  My research is an ethnobotanical analysis of the plants and people within the geographic region known as the Sea of Fire."

Myasara smiles at Ysaeril.

Alisaire looks thoughtfully at Ysaeril.

Vanathys whispers, "Most fascinating.  If you have any samples, I would be interested in some for my personal collection."

Rohese nods slowly at Mirkk.

The shadowy black cat licks its left paw, seemingly oblivious to the world around it.

Missandai tilts her head toward Ysaeril, examining her intently as the tip of one ear twitches briefly.

Ysaeril hesitantly asks, "I have more to say, but shall I submit this draft to anyone now for your perusal?"

You quietly whisper to Vanathys, "I do indeed - shall I mail them to you?"

Ysaeril bites her lip.

Vanathys nods to you.

Bakarus glances at Ysaeril.

You smile at Vanathys.

Brilliant flames of reds, oranges, and yellows from the starburst chandelier flicker and fade, before flaring into new life.

You gaze with interest at Ysaeril.

Aendir asks, "Does anyone wish to review the Lady's draft?"

Aendir casually observes his surroundings.

Ysaeril awkwardly says, "Very well, I shall continue.  If anyone would like to look at my research, please raise your hand."

Vanathys raises his hand.

Alisaire nods at Ysaeril.

Aendir smiles.

Ysaeril offers Vanathys an aged leather compass-clasped notebook.

Vanathys accepts Ysaeril's compass-clasped notebook.

Ysaeril nods appreciatively at Vanathys.

Zenlynn says, "I would and I believe the Mirror would as well."

Aendir takes a flat-crowned felted wool hat adorned with a sleek kingfisher pinion off his head.

Zenlynn nods at Myasara.

Ysaeril says, "The Sea of Fire is a dry and arid desert region located in the western section of the Elanith continent, and its most prominent inhabitants are semi-nomadic human tribes of known collectively as the Tehir.  The first stage of my discovery and analysis occurred between 5104 through 5107 and from indigenous healers of five separate Tehir tribes, both sedent and nomadic.  I identified several species of plants and their cultural significance during my travels there."

Mirkk casually observes his surroundings.

Meril cocks her head.

Ysaeril lightly says, "My works incorporate hand-drawn illustrations taken from observation, scientific definitions for speices as known to the Masters of Lore, as the plant is known among the Tehir, and also, its Common name given by those of the Turamzzyrian Empire.  The first chapter, which I have brought today, begins with the Cactacae family of plants, or Cactus in Common.  Among the tribes I visited,"" she pauses and then says carefully, "they called this plant family "gOgraz."

You cock your head.

Missandai leans forward.

Rohese whispers something to Mirkk.

Mirkk nods understandingly at Rohese.

Myasara folds her hands in her lap.

You see Lady Ysaeril Illistim.
She appears to be an Elf.
She is of a middling height and has a slender build.  She appears to be youthful.  She has long-lashed vibrant violet eyes and fair skin.  She has long, shiny pale blonde hair worn neat and loose beneath the gentle drape of a triple-stranded vaalin geldaralad suspending a clouded maize-colored citrine at the brow.  She has a delicate face, a small nose and a narrow chin that matches the cleft between her slender clavicles.
She has some small silver rings each adorned with a sprig of tiny auroral starflowers set along the slender tips of her pointed ears.
A scintillating grid of silver and gold energy glows brightly beneath her.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing some uneven glaesine filaments bearing a beryl green crystal-filled geode cluster, a pewter marbrinus dolman accented with orphrey, a subtly creweled kirtle of rime-swept lilac paeline, and a pair of dove grey leather slippers on low tapered heels.

Ysaeril says, "Upon acceptance of this proposal, I intend on completing this first chapter with more cactacae species, followed by chapters on herbs and grasses, trees and bushes; and also vining plants.  Regarding future discoveries and additions to the Royal Arboretum, I recommend a new wing for desert climes, such that it could support specimens transported back from the aforementioned region."

Zenlynn nods.

Rohese smiles.

You nod in agreement.

Rohese nods enthusiastically at Arenglae!

Aendir curiously says, "I should like to see these specimines."

Ysaeril awkwardly adds, "Further, if this proposal is approved, I humbly request permission for temporary leave from the Shining City, as required, to complete my research.  Specimen collection shall be necessary if we are to build a collection for the Arboretum."

Ysaeril smiles as she speaks, her expression widening into an animated and eager grin.

Rohese smiles.

Aendir appears to be trying hard not to grin.

Ysaeril hastily adds, "I also would like to learn more about grafting practices I encountered briefly during my prior travels.   Not only to understand how it is done, but of course, *why*!  There is something promising in it, and I am very eager to learn more."

Vanathys browses through the notebook, one ear tilted towards Ysaeril.

Mirkk raises an eyebrow in Ysaeril's direction.

Rohese surreptitiously glances at Mirkk.

Ysaeril reaches out and touches a polished linden stand.

Myasara says, "Of course Lady Ysaeril, you are free to come and go as you need.  This work is very important to you, and I look forward to the additions."

Rohese smiles.

Ysaeril smiles at Myasara.

Ysaeril says, "I thank you, Argent Mirror."

Rohese whispers something to Mirkk.

Mirkk nods quickly at Rohese!

Rohese smiles at Mirkk.

Ysaeril stammers, "If you please, are there any questions?"

Vhaelynia scribbles a few extra notes, trying to read over Vanathys' shoulder.

Meril raises her hand.

Feriae giggles at Vhaelynia.

Rohese glances between Vhaelynia and Vanathys.

Vanathys offers Zenlynn an aged leather compass-clasped notebook.

Rohese smiles quietly to herself.

Zenlynn accepts Vanathys's compass-clasped notebook.

Ysaeril nods appreciatively at Vanathys.

Ysaeril turns to face Meril.

You smile at Ysaeril.

Zenlynn carefully opens her compass-clasped notebook.


Mirkk glances nervously around the room.

"HAAAALP!" screams a peacock to his mate, somewhere amid the surrounding foliage.

Speaking lightly to Meril, Ysaeril asks, "Apologies, did you have a question for me?"

Vhaelynia tentatively raises her hand.

With an empathetic nod, Rohese discreetly takes Mirkk's hand in hers and gives it a momentary squeeze.

Meril ponders.

Zenlynn offers Myasara an aged leather compass-clasped notebook.

Meril carefully asks, "In your time among the people of the Sea of Fire, have they ever spoken of any myths of when the land was not yet a desert?"

Mirkk glances appreciatively at Rohese.

Myasara accepts Zenlynn's compass-clasped notebook.

Rohese winks at Mirkk.

Aendir cocks his head at Meril.

Speaking carefully to Meril, Ysaeril replies, "The people I was with do not like to talk about those times, but yes."

Meril nods thoughtfully.

You furrow your brow, probably adding a wrinkle or two in the process.

Mirkk surreptitiously glances at Zenlynn.

Mirkk nods understandingly at Rohese.

Myasara looks over the book in her hands and leafs through the notes.

Zenlynn rubs one of her hands slowly before stretching it out.

Zenlynn raises her hand.

Zenlynn smiles at Ysaeril.

Vanathys raises his hand.

Ysaeril says, "Apologies, if there are no more questions, I shall hand the floor to our next member."

Ysaeril says, "Oh."

Rohese smiles.

Ysaeril smiles at Vanathys.

Vhaelynia blushes a delicate shade of pink.

Vhaelynia tentatively raises her hand again.

Ysaeril smiles at Vhaelynia.

Ysaeril glances between Vanathys and Vhaelynia.

Ysaeril awkwardly says, "By all means.."

Vhaelynia blurts out nervously, "If it please, my lady, do you have a particular favorite plant from the Sea of Fire?  Or do you just like all of them equally?"

Vhaelynia blushes and babbles a few incoherent words, looking sincerely flustered.

You chuckle to yourself.

Vhaelynia says, "I've never been, and....it sounds so interesting."

Vanathys smiles quietly to himself.

Rohese agrees with Vanathys.

Aendir grins.

Vanathys winks at Rohese.

Aendir says, "I, too, am curious to hear this answer."

Speaking to Vhaelynia, Ysaeril says, "I do have a favorite, but it comes with a story for another day."

Rohese wiggles her nose at Vanathys.

Ysaeril smiles at Vhaelynia.

Aendir grins.

Lucrecea smiles at Ysaeril.

Vhaelynia fidgets awkwardly with her quill and mutters to herself, "I should have brought some liqueur."

You quietly whisper to Ysaeril, "The students are rather charmingly eager, aren't they?"

Vhaelynia says, "Oh yes, of course."

Vhaelynia nods.

Vhaelynia blushes a delicate shade of pink.

Vanathys just nudged Vhaelynia.

Teveriel gazes in amusement at Vhaelynia.

Speaking to Vanathys, Feriae whispers aloud, "...can we linger for another day, sir?"

Vhaelynia jots down a few more notes in her journal.

Vanathys nods at Feriae.

Speaking to Vanathys, Ysaeril asks, "You had a question?"

Zenlynn raises her hand.

Aendir begins chuckling at Feriae!

Mirkk glances nervously at Rohese.

Vanathys says, "More of a statement that I have experience with grafting, if you ever need more details on it, I'd be happy to share my experience and research."

Ysaeril smiles at Vanathys.

Rohese beams, her eyes filled with delight!

Rohese just nudged Mirkk.

Vanathys nods at Ysaeril.

Mirkk looks thoughtfully at Vanathys.

Speaking gratefully to Vanathys, Ysaeril replies, "I appreciate that very much, you shall be hearing from me."

Vanathys nods at Ysaeril.

Vanathys glances at Zenlynn.

Rohese nods encouragingly at Mirkk.

Ysaeril whispers, "Far more interest than I expected!"

Mirkk glances at Rohese.

Mirkk points at himself.

Rohese smiles.

Zenlynn says, "My question was a bit about the grafting as well..."

Vhaelynia whispers a bit too loudly to Feriae, "Told you knows all about joining things."

Ysaeril nods at Zenlynn.

Zenlynn asks, "Have you done any and had success?"

Speaking softly to Mirkk, Rohese whispers aloud, "After this next question, yes."

Mirkk breathes very slowly and looks much calmer.

Feriae nods enthusiastically at Vhaelynia!

You quietly whisper to Ysaeril, "Your research is fascinating, especially given the exotic locale."

Ysaeril says, "I myself? No, I have not. It was a curiosity I saw while in the Sea of Fire.  However, I did not want to butcher any plants testing that which I did not know well enough."

Ysaeril carefully says, "I wish to learn their process from their perspective."

Zenlynn says, "I look forward to seeing the techniques you learn, it is an interesting subject."

Zenlynn nods.

Ysaeril agrees with Zenlynn.

Myasara offers Ysaeril an aged leather compass-clasped notebook.

Ysaeril accepts Myasara's compass-clasped notebook.

You nod understandingly.

Alisaire nods approvingly at Ysaeril.

Rohese smiles at Mirkk.

Myasara glances at Zenlynn.

Speaking quietly to Rohese, Mirkk mouths, "Me?"

Ysaeril fidgets.

Mirkk nods slowly.

Ysaeril turns to face Mirkk.

Speaking to Mirkk, Ysaeril says, "If you please."

Ysaeril takes a few graceful steps backward.

Ysaeril walks over to the chairs and settles down.

Mirkk nervously squeaks, "Good-"

Rohese gazes proudly at Mirkk.

Vanathys gazes at Mirkk.

Lucrecea smiles at Ysaeril.

Mirkk clears his throat.

Arenglae studies Mirkk, giving him an intense consideration.

Rohese softly giggles.

Rohese lowers her gaze.

Aendir smiles.

Aendir reaches over and gently rests his hand on your arm.

Bakarus gazes through the crystalline lens of his monocle, his eyes roving over every inch of Mirkk.

Aendir whispers, "You've done quite well. As always."

Mirkk calmly states, "Good evening. I am Mirkk Timbertree-Bayvel, for those of whom their acquaintance I've not yet made."

Aendir smiles.

Rohese gazes fondly at Mirkk.

You quietly whisper to Aendir, "I only hope the topic compelling enough to include facilities for further research in the renovation plans."

Aendir whispers, "I'd say we're off to a good start."

Mirkk calmly continues, "And my research isn't so very uncommon to what has already been proposed or spoke of this evening. My proposal is that of Inosculation. Simply, the natural occurance of grafting."

You lean softly against Aendir.

Alisaire inclines her head.

Aendir cocks his head at Mirkk.

Mirkk calmly continues, "Inosculation is that natural, yet sometimes guided, process of sharing tissue of like-species plants, either at the root, stem, or branch."

Mirkk calmly offers, "To the point that the plants share the same life-force. If one thrives, so does the other. If one withers, as does the other."

Mirkk looks less aware of the surroundings.

Ysaeril perspires delicately.

Teveriel nods knowingly.

Mirkk thoughtfully notes, "It isn't uncommon for Sylvan or Faendryl to plant marriage trees, two planted close together, ultimately becoming one. This is no different."

Mirkk thoughtfully remarks, "But these trees, to my limited knowledge, have not been studied specifically over the years for topics such as disease resistance, shared nutrition..."
Arenglae takes a drink from her crystal goblet.

Speaking fondly to Rohese, Mirkk says, "Or even shared sentience."

Speaking softly to Mirkk, Rohese whispers aloud, "Something else to consider."

Mirkk calmly proposes, "I offer the experiment to conduct inosculation of like-species tree, perhaps gardenia would be a suitable starting species..."

Bakarus nods understandingly.

Rohese nods approvingly.

Zenlynn nods.

Mirkk carefully remarks, "To be studied over time. Multiple pairings would be recommended, as introduction of disease for study of effect is ill advised with a single pair."

Mirkk carefully proposes, "And with multiple pairs, one could study the inosculation of roots only, branches only, and trunks only, or any combination thereof."

Mirkk awkwardly apologizes, "But I am getting ahead of myself."

You see High Lord Mirkk Timbertree.
He appears to be a Human from Bourth.
He is tall.  He appears to be an adult.  He has piercing dark blue-green eyes and tanned skin.  He has shoulder-length, flowing rich mahogany hair drawn back in a nape-hugging ponytail.  He has a rugged face and a broad chest.  A speckled white hawk feather quill tipped with a spiraled dark vaalin nib is tucked behind his ear.
He is in good shape.
He is wearing a resplendent violet satin cravat with a silvery peacock pattern, a knee-length grey tweed topcoat threaded with a subtle herringbone pattern, a viridian jacquard waistcoat with an elegant white feather pattern, a finespun periwinkle silk shirt fastened by a line of ivory buttons, a gold feather quill curling to form a wedding band on his left ring finger, some svelte dove grey wool trousers with charcoal black silk trim, and a pair of black granulated leather boots buckled with nielloed silver.


Rohese leans over and whispers, "He's rather excited about this project, can you tell?"

You gaze in amusement at Rohese.

Rohese wrinkles her nose.

Mirkk confidently states, "The result is a better understanding of whether inosculation is beneficial to agriculture, viticulture, and possible preservation of ailing or aging trees of significant value throughout Elanthia."

Mirkk nervously blurts, "I hope that made sense."

Mirkk clears his throat.

Lucrecea smiles at Mirkk.

Missandai smiles.

Vhaelynia says, "The pairing of different types of grape for inosculation may be interesting for viticulture especially."

Vanathys says, "It did."

Meril nods rhythmically.

Speaking reassuringly to Mirkk, Rohese whispers aloud, "Perfect sense, my love."

Bakarus nods at Mirkk.

Myasara says, "Very much so."

Vhaelynia says, "Oenologically speaking, would it impact the grapes themselves, and thus the final product."

Rohese cocks her head at Vhaelynia.

Speaking quietly to Vanathys, Mirkk says, "And shared disesase resistance amongs vines could help strengthen the health of the vineyard."

Vanathys agrees with Mirkk.

Vhaelynia blushes a delicate shade of pink.

Vhaelynia clasps her hand over her mouth.

Rohese smiles.

Arenglae nods sagely.

Speaking curiously to Vanathys, Feriae says, "Would we be allowed to create our own vintages."

Feriae quickly says, "For research."

Rohese giggles softly at Feriae.

Speaking to Feriae, Vanathys says, "As if I could stop you two."

Myasara says, "New roses..."

Speaking interestedly to Vhaelynia, you say, "It would be quite something to be able to plan such an influence on the flavor of a vintage one plans to bottle decades hence."

Vhaelynia makes several notes in her journal.

Missandai laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement from Feriae.

Lucrecea gives a sidelong glance at Feriae.

Mirkk awkwardly inquires, "Are there any questions for me?"

Rolling her eyes and tossing her head back, Lucrecea titters loudly, then abruptly quiets, immediately shifting to a calm, composed demeanor.

Mirkk glances nervously around the room.

Mirkk glances uneasily at Rohese.

Zenlynn ponders.

Zenlynn says, "It would make sense that crops would be better for this."

Speaking sheepishly to Mirkk, Rohese admits, "You're braver than I am, I didn't even offer the floor for questions."

Rohese wrinkles her nose.

Vhaelynia starts to raise her hand, but notices how uneasy the speaker looks and pulls it back down again.

Mirkk glances at Vhaelynia.

Speaking to Mirkk, Vanathys says, "If the proposal is approved, I am doing a study on increasing the frost resistance and general hardiness of plants from samples I took from the Hinterwilds.  It may be of note with your study in the future."

Vanathys says, "Crops in particular."

Vanathys ponders.

Rohese beams, her eyes filled with delight!

Speaking amusedly to Rohese, you murmur, "I had the same thought earlier when Lady Ysaeril bravely opened the floor as well."

Myasara says, "Such research would have been useful when the long winter came to Ta'Vaalor."

Rohese excitedly exclaims, "A collaborative study!"

Vanathys nods at Myasara.

Rohese giggles softly at you.

Lucrecea nods.

Zenlynn rubs one gloved hand.

Zenlynn glances away.

Rohese agrees with Myasara.

Speaking to Myasara, Vanathys says, "Precisely what put me on that path."

Mirkk nods almost imperceptibly.

Mirkk awkwardly notes, "It seems several of us are interested in grafting and inosculation. We'll have many notes to compare."

Speaking to Feriae, Vhaelynia says, "When we go back to Kraken's Fall for our studies, we must search for inosculated trees and send this good man our findings."

Vhaelynia is admiring Mirkk.

Vhaelynia nods at Feriae.

Ysaeril smiles at Mirkk.

Vanathys whispers something to Vhaelynia.

Rohese smiles at Mirkk.

Vanathys gives a sidelong glance at Vhaelynia.

Mirkk glances dubiously around the room.

Mirkk slowly strides a few steps backward.

Vanathys glances dubiously at Vhaelynia.

Mirkk smiles.

Myasara says, "It is an interesting topic for many."

Vanathys applauds Mirkk.

Myasara nods.

Vhaelynia applauds.

Meril applauds Mirkk politely.

Speaking to Feriae, Vhaelynia says, "And perhaps we can start our own experiment with grapes if Vanathys lets us."

Aendir gives you a lingering kiss on the cheek.

Arenglae applauds politely.

Rohese whispers something to Mirkk.

Arenglae's silvered arctic fox jumps down from her arms and lands lightly on the ground.
Mirkk smiles at Rohese.
Rohese casually glances about, her misty grey eyes reflective pools that mirror everything around her.

Speaking to Vhaelynia, Vanathys says, "I have space in the gardens for such an activity."

Speaking happily to Vhaelynia, Feriae says, "Did you see my experiment with the local spices?  I left a stand in the market...I hope everyone's okay."

Rohese nods enthusiastically at Mirkk!

Speaking to Feriae, Vhaelynia exclaims, "They were lovely!"

Myasara smiles at Rohese.

Speaking respectfully to Myasara, Rohese says, "I do believe that was the last presentation of the afternoon, Argent Mirror."

Myasara asks, "May I?"

Ysaeril turns to face Myasara.

Speaking softly to Myasara, Rohese allows, "Please!"

Myasara asks, "Could you recap the physical additions that you wish to make?"

Arenglae turns an inquisitive ear toward Myasara.

Speaking softly to Myasara, Rohese says, "Of course."

Speaking softly to Myasara, Rohese says, "The initial proposal suggested a glass construction as an addition to the Arboretum but of course, this has scope to be vast."

Rohese smiles.

Myasara says, "How many rooms would this crystal construction need for research."

Speaking tentatively to Myasara, Rohese proposes, "So, with the Council's approval, perhaps several greenhouses and conservatories would be ideal."

Rohese glances around the room.

Rohese softly says, "I am sure my colleagues could make suggestions as to what they desire."

Rohese wrinkles her nose.

Shadows distort oddly underfoot, lengthening and creeping in disjointed angles to pool beneath Alisaire's dusky leather boots.

Ysaeril thoughtfully offers, "For my own part, a single wing in the conservatory will suit."

Aendir says, "I am certain some private funding could be arranged, as well."

Myasara says, "And what should we do with the current rooms that the public can meander through."

Rohese nods at Ysaeril.

Bakarus says, "If I might offer a suggestion, perhaps a secure area as well...in the case any toxic plants are to be studied?  One cannot be too careful."

You lightly say, "For mycological study, a glass enclosure is.. Not ideal."

Speaking softly to Myasara, Rohese says, "I don't see the need to change them at this stage."

Rohese softly agrees, "We would need a secure research facility."

Myasara says, "The original plan had a dome spit into sections with lab rooms I bellieve."

Myasara ponders.

Ysaeril blurts, "Oh!"

Speaking softly to Myasara, Rohese says, "Indeed, Argent Mirror, but I am inclined to be more demanding at this point."

Alisaire gives a sidelong glance to her left.

Rohese wrinkles her nose.

Rohese cocks her head at Ysaeril.

Myasara says, "As am I."

Myasara smiles at Rohese.

You pleasantly say, "Fortunately most buildings require a basement and a laboratory thus located would be adequate for the growth of mushrooms, and also more easily made secure."

Rohese nods in agreement to you.

Myasara says, "We are very supportive of this project, but we have a plan as well."

Ysaeril smiles.

Rohese smiles at Myasara.

Vanathys says, "I can provide the plans on how my private facilities work for the needs of different flora, though I imagine mine are much smaller in scope, if that would be of us."

You smile at Vanathys.

Speaking understandingly to Myasara, Rohese says, "Of course."

Rohese nods appreciatively at Vanathys.

Myasara says, "We also wish those public rooms to be redone and added to."

The air around Alisaire's ghezyte serpent anklet warps for an instant, distending its features hideously.

Vanathys says, "I'm sure they are stored somewhere..."

Lucrecea murmurs, "Excuse me."

Mirkk politely comments, "Me also."

Speaking politely to Mirkk, Rohese reminds, "Don't forget you are needed ..."

Mirkk kisses Rohese on the cheek for what seems like an eternity.

Myasara says, "There others most likely less research inclined than you, but would like to assist in some way."

Speaking lightly to Aendir, you say, "Such as private funding."

Aendir chuckles to himself.

Speaking softly to Myasara, Rohese acknowledges, "I am sure there are many others who would wish to have an input into the design and construction of such a wonderful addition."

Rohese softly echoes, "Such as funding."

Rohese nods slowly to you.

Rohese surreptitiously glances at Aendir.

Rohese lowers her gaze.

Rohese glances at Aendir, her lips curving up in a slow, coy fashion.

Myasara says, "There is funding for both, I am sure."

Myasara says, "I know that the research facility will be quite the task."

Speaking tentatively to Myasara, Rohese adds, "And, as a final request, might it be possible to allow for a repository of information - a place for eager students."

Myasara says, "That can be considered as well."

Ferghal clears his throat.

You agree, "Indeed, a working library will be critical."

You nod at Rohese.

Speaking to Vhaelynia, Feriae whispers aloud, "Are we being volunteered?"

Rohese softly continues, "The sharing of knowledge is everything."

Rohese nods enthusiastically!

Myasara asks, "With the proper funding would the group be willing to assist in the public displays as well with other's who are interested, or at least be a resource to those who are?"
Speaking to Feriae, Vhaelynia says, "We may need more wine for this."

Speaking graciously to Myasara, Rohese responds, "For my part - and my husband's - we would gladly assist."

Rohese smiles at Feriae.

Myasara says, "I would not expect you to take on two large projects, but I also would not stifle your interest either."

Ysaeril lightly says, "I am willing, as able."

Ferghal smiles at Rohese.

You say, "Taking on the role of facilities advisor is perhaps the fondest wish of any researcher."

You chuckle to yourself.

You nod.

Rohese agrees with you.

Myasara asks, "May I have time to discuss with the council?"

Speaking quietly in Elven to Rohese, Ferghal asks, "Has there been any thought as to a seed bank? Some way of preserving species, in case of devastation?"

Speaking graciously to Myasara, Rohese allows, "I think I speak for us all when I say that we would be very interested to hear the Council's thoughts."

Myasara says, "Your research is quite compelling."

Myasara says, "And the thing we can expect from such a group."

Myasara says, "But, this project has my support."

Ysaeril beams!

Rohese beams at Myasara, her eyes filled with delight!

Myasara says, "'I will have Lord Aeriadrn be in touch after I speak with the Council."

Rohese claps her hands together in delight!

Aendir whispers, "Well done my dear."

Speaking appreciatively to Myasara, Rohese says, "Thank you for allowing us all to present today."

Aendir gives you a lingering kiss on the cheek.

You smile at Aendir.

Ysaeril eagerly says, "Yes, yes thank you."

Ysaeril stands up.

Myasara says, "Thank you for your presentations and the effort and creativity that came with them."
