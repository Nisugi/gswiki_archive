</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="PART_1_Ceremony">PART 1 Ceremony</span></h2>
<p>You are momentarily flooded with a feeling of excitement as you glance over the information on your black vellum invitation.
As you read over the wedding details, the the invitation's words begin to shimmer and glow.  Your surroundings become hazy, and you feel yourself being pulled away...
When your vision clears, you see your location has changed.
</p><p>To your surprise, a Wedding Hall attendant is waiting for you, greets you with a comforting smile, and says, "Welcome, Opalina.  Your dressing room is freshly cleaned and ready for you to prepare for the ceremony.  Relax, clear your mind, and place any unneeded belongings in the large storage chest that has been provided just for you.  Your items will remain there until your wedding has ended, at which time you will have 30 minutes to return and pick them up.  Please be prompt so that you don't lose any special belongings when we clean the room for the next wedding party."
With a gentle hand, the attendant carefully attaches the invitation to you such that it's nearly unnoticeable by anyone but you.  "There.  No one else will notice, but now you won't forget it, and you'll need that in order to access the entry portal once you leave your dressing room.  You can still use its teleportation magic even while it's tucked away like this.  Congratulations to you, Opalina.  Enjoy your very special day!"  And with that, the attendant turns and leaves the cabin.
</p><p><b>[Palm Tree Grove, Dressing Room]</b>
</p><p><i>Sheltered from the grove, the small hut is spacious enough to be cozy and covered with heavy drapes to ensure privacy.  Anchored to the peaked ceiling, a small fan attached to a pulley system lazily rotates and keeps the air from getting stale.  Positioned near the exit, a full length mirror offers visitors a chance to view themselves, while a nearby chest provides storage space and a high-backed wooden chair supplies a place to rest.</i>
Obvious exits: out<i></i>
</p><p>You look at yourself carefully in the full length mirror...
</p><p>You see Chronicler Opalina Gemiena the Town Councillor of Icemule Trace.
She appears to be a Half-Elf.
</p><p>She is quite short for one of elven heritage and has a curvy-figured shape.  She appears to be in the meridian of life.  She has dark feather-lashed arctic blue eyes and freckled skin.  She has winter rose-dotted, curly deep auburn hair delicately rolled into an off-center chignon that leaves a few feathery tendrils to trail in front of her ears and down the nape of her neck.  She has an evenly proportioned, plain face, a freckled nose and slightly pointed ears.  Tiny flecks of sea blue have formed within her pupils.  She has a fake silver-edged tooth barely visible in her mouth.
</p><p>She has a tiny red crystal rose in her right nostril, a niveous-inked fall of tiny snowflakes on her ear, a ring of red roses tattoo on her waist, a teacup-cradled clockwork mouse tattoo on her leg, a petite faceted ruby arrow in the upper ridge of her right ear, and a set of silver rings with tiny dangling crystalline snowflakes in the upper ridge of her left ear.
</p><p>She is in good shape.
</p><p>Swirls of pale silver snowflakes fall slowly across her form, glistening faintly as she moves.
She is wearing a scallop-edged snowy lace veil with icy blue silk accents, a multi-chained eonake ferroniere dangling a ten-pointed gardenia white diamond, an antique eonake ornament with a subtle dark blue sea glass dolphin mosaic, an antique sea glass back pendant with snow white pearl beads, an embroidered icy blue velvet evening wrap with soft snow white mink trim, a flowing silvery silk train embroidered with icy blue amaranth applique, a flecked pearl white lizard, a ruffle-edged deep blue silk garter with silvery moon and star embroidery, an empire-waist silvery silk bridal gown with snowy chiffon bell sleeves with a light winter white lace underdress dotted with tiny eonake beadwork underneath, a wiregrass bracelet, a thick ebonwood armband, a quilted black spidersilk sack with silk drawstrings, and some sheer pewter-hued stockings under some frosted diamond-beaded icy blue silk shoes lofted on crystalline heels.
</p><p><br/>
You slowly and deliberately empty your filled lungs.
</p><p>[Private]-GSIV:Hammerrhead: "Hey, I have to go pretty soon."
</p><p>[Private]-GSIV:Hammerrhead: "I just want to wish you and Falvicar the best."

</p><p>- IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT THIS WEDDING INVITATION -
</p><p>TRAVEL TO THE WEDDING
For your convenience, this invitation can be used to aid you in your travels to the event.  You can RAISE the invitation to reach the wedding area.  This can only be done while you are within/near town.  The teleport ability will become available 30 minutes before the wedding's scheduled time.  (IE: If a wedding is scheduled for 3:00 PM, then this ability will become available at 2:30 PM.)  This ability is available for the duration of the wedding celebration.
DURATION OF WEDDING
Guests may begin arriving 30 minutes before the scheduled event time; the wedding ceremony will begin promptly at the scheduled time, and the event will last for 5 hours (beginning with the ceremony) after which time you will be returned to your starting point.  You may also exit the grounds as needed before the event's end via the exit portal.
MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION
This invitation was given specifically to you by the wedding party, and it is non-transferable.  Handing the invitation to another or dropping the invitation on the ground will result in a permanent loss of the document.  Please keep this in a safe and secure place*!
If you want to retain the invitation as a keepsake, be sure you FOLD the invitation before the end of the wedding.  Otherwise, it will be destroyed at the end of the event, and it is ineligible for replacement.
Spells will be stripped upon entry to the wedding area.  Please refrain from replacing them until the ceremony is over so that distractions are at a minimum.  After all, this is a special day for the wedding couple!
If you remove an invitation from the pouch that doesn't get used (ie: the intended recipient moves or disconnects), you can put it back into the pouch.  If you drop it on the ground, it will be destroyed.
You and your spouse will both need an invitation; yours was placed in your TRUNK, separate from the pouch.  (Note that only one of you received an invitation pouch.)  Please keep your invitation in a safe place*.  You will need it to access your dressing rooms and the wedding area.
You will each have access to a special dressing room 30 minutes before the start of your wedding.  Each quarter has a chest for you to store your belongings, if you so desire.  The contents will remain up to 30 minutes after the wedding, at which time they will be removed, so don't forget to return and pick them up promptly following the end of your celebration to avoid any loss of items.
You and your spouse can use the invitation's KISS ability to access your dressing room from either town or from within the wedding glade.
</p>
<ul><li>When you access the wedding area for the first time, your invitation will be pinned to you by one of the Wedding Hall attendants.  This will be attached discreetly so that only you can see it, but you can continue to interact with it normally.  Once you leave the celebration, if you REMOVE the invitation, it will remove it from your inventory and destroy it.  Do not remove it until you have returned home.</li></ul>

</p><p><i>Wild vanilla orchids are interspersed among the tall palm trees that ring this small space.  Soft grasses sprout from the white sand covering the ground.  The sound of falling water is carried on the slightly salty breeze emanating from a shimmering portal that glows with a faint aqua hue.  You also see the cauldron-shaped Rozy disk.</i>

</p><p>A representative from the Palm Tree Grove wedding area peruses a list of names on a clipboard and says, "Welcome back, Opalina. "We hope you are enjoying your visit."

</p><p><b>[Palm Tree Grove, Shoreline]</b>
</p><p><i>Stark white sand defines the crescent-shaped beach lapped by the crystalline aqua sea, and at the midpoint, two giant palm trees arc toward each other, framing a winding path.  Twists of sunny yellow trumpet flowers and sea green jade vines lace the fronds and garland to each trunk.  A smooth flat rock sits at the water's edge, providing an unobstructed view of the moonlight reflecting off the water.  You also see the cauldron-shaped Rozy disk and a glowing exit portal.</i>

</p><p>Your pearl white lizard nips at the air.  Whether it has glimpsed a gnat or has succumbed to a case of wishful thinking is uncertain.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Ohh there is a table if you'd like to place it on there."
</p><p>Missoni flounces in amidst a diffuse cloud of prismatic glitter.
</p><p>Goldstr says, "Ah."

</p><p>Your pearl white lizard suddenly begins whining and hissing.  You feel it erupt into a flurry of movement on your shoulder!  Its tail smacks you several times on the side of your head.  Wincing at the blows, you try to quiet the lizard by patting it reassuringly.  Then you notice what caused the creature's agitation.  A small black fly is winging away into the distance.  The lizard follows the insect's progress, a wistful expression in its eyes.

<b>[Palm Tree Grove, Waterfall]</b>
</p><p><br/>
<i>Through a gate-like pair of giant fronds sits a verdant pool, perpetually filled by a small, crystal clear waterfall.  Catching the moonlight as it tumbles over a series of boulders, the water staggers downward, ending in a sheer curtain against a flora-bedecked cliff side.  Surrounding trailing tendrils of jade vine and trumpet flower almost obscure an alabaster bench overlooking this restful setting.  A winding path leads down to the water's edge.  You also see the faenor Chandrellia disk inlaid with intersecting bands of jet and a gift table covered with a wedding bell-motif moonlight silver cloth with some stuff on it.</i>

</p><p><b>[Palm Tree Grove, Canopy]</b>
</p><p><i>Palm trees line the perimeter of the large clearing, and wide braided ribbons of aqua, gold, and silver, tied at the same height on each trunk, connect to each with a slightly looped festoon.  A moonlit mahogany-planked dance floor takes up much of the area, leaving just enough room for guests to enjoy refreshments from a maoral serving table and a tan wicker pedestal.  Braced to each tree is a crystalline sconce set with flickering candles that give off a soft glow.  You also see a lagoon blue glass bowl.</i>

<i>A large grove of palm trees rings a tulle-canopied dais set at the center, within several concentric rows of beribboned chairs.  Rising in the middle of the dais is an alabaster scallop shell altar.

Anchored to the peaked ceiling, a small fan attached to a pulley system lazily rotates and keeps the air from getting stale.

Stark white sand defines the crescent-shaped beach lapped by the crystalline aqua sea, and at the midpoint, two giant palm trees arc toward each other, framing a winding path.

Through a gate-like pair of giant fronds sits a verdant pool, perpetually filled by a small, crystal clear waterfall.  Catching the moonlight as it tumbles over a series of boulders, the water staggers downward, ending in a sheer curtain against a flora-bedecked cliff side.  Surrounding trailing tendrils of jade vine and trumpet flower almost obscure an alabaster bench overlooking this restful setting.  A winding path leads down to the water's edge.  You also see a gift table covered with a wedding bell-motif moonlight silver cloth with some stuff on it.

A moonlit mahogany-planked dance floor takes up much of the area, leaving just enough room for guests to enjoy refreshments from a maoral serving table and a tan wicker pedestal.  Braced to each tree is a crystalline sconce set with flickering candles that give off a soft glow.  You also see a lagoon blue glass bowl.</i>

</p><p>You analyze your keepsake album and sense that the creator has provided the following information:
The Keepsake Album allows couples to store memories of their wedding ceremony, reception, and honeymoon.  It comes preset with the invitation, menu, and a sketch of the cake, and all three will reflect any changes made afterward.  While in the wedding and honeymoon areas, the album can create hardcopy portraits of people, rooms, and objects, as well as store the following:
