<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Log">Log</span></h2>
<p>Speaking to Xavanna, Kakoon says, "Glad you could make it."
</p><p>Xavanna exclaims, "Wouldn't miss it!"
</p><p>Xavanna says, "I'm going to keep reading some class stuff until this gets rolling."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Sup sup."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "The sun dared come out so now I'm having to wear my sunhat to see the screen. I look deranged."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "I'm not staying long. I gotta get the kids to basketball in about 30."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "I'll fill you in on anything you miss."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Thanks."
</p><p>The voice of Elysani says, "They cancelled basketball here, but we also got 13+ inches of snow yesterday."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "But I'm sure someone will have a log."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "Yeah, that sounds like a good reason to cancel."
</p><p>The voice of Elysani says, "We just got access to the road beyond the driveway like an hour ago."
</p><p>Jaysehn asks, "Snow?"
</p><p>The voice of Xeraphina exclaims, "Yay, snow!"
</p><p>Xavanna says, "I am ready for snow."
</p><p>The voice of Elysani says, "All the snow."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Xavanna says, "Nice entrance."
</p><p>Jaysehn cheerfully says, "I've got 50 degrees here."
</p><p>Velien says, "It's tough to dribble on snow."
</p><p>The voice of Xeraphina says, "That's when you drool on snow instead."
</p><p>Speaking to Xavanna, Casil says, "I thought about riding in on a golden wyvern surrounded with crimson flames."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Xavanna says, "Too subtle."
</p><p>Casil says, "Followed by a legion of elves in crimson and gold armor."
</p><p>Casil says, "And Anarquendi with a tornado of dragonstalks."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "Now we're talking."
</p><p>Speaking to Gyres, Casil says, "I had the cutout but I don't need to use it, I guess."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Gyres says, "I figured I'd stop lurking for this one."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "We are outnumbered."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "GMs everywhere..."
</p><p>Xeraphina exclaims, "GMs, where?!"
</p><p>Jaysehn exclaims, "Hah!"
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Busted."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "VolnCo wins."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "Don't forget to tip your hat."
</p><p>Speaking to Jaysehn, Uniana asks, "Did you just symbol them?"
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Yup."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "Right... I think I had that to test something... one moment."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "And 3 of them are corpos."
</p><p>Uniana says, "Better get the stake."
</p><p>Casil says, "Elysani is an armored chicken."
</p><p>Casil says, "I mean Casil is."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I am Voln no more."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Damn."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "This is how cyberpunk started."
</p><p>Speaking to Jaysehn, Xavanna says, "You tipped your hand."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "No one leaves the corp."
</p><p>Speaking to Jaysehn, Xeraphina says, "Sounds suspiciously like a cult."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "Newest cat has discovered the sunhat. One moment."
</p><p>Casil asks, "Why is everyone afraid of the cart?"
</p><p>Elaejia says, "BIg Ranger. Much sneak."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Xavanna says, "Because it looks like it's going to bite."
</p><p>Speaking to Elaejia, Casil says, "Very sneaky."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Ah....copper. My new mortal enemy."
</p><p>Casil asks, "Should I even ask?"
</p><p>Jaysehn asks, "Copper?"
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Can't dye it."
</p><p>Speaking to Tylanthriel, Xavanna says, "You've been missing all the fun."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven to Xavanna, Tylanthriel exclaims, "I was doing elf military stuff!"
</p><p>Casil says, "I'll give people a couple more minutes."
</p><p>Casil says, "Since they were at drill or something."
</p><p>Speaking to Tylanthriel, Xavanna says, "I am much more important."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Elaejia exclaims, "What, free minutes?  You better charge for them!"
</p><p>Speaking to Elaejia, Casil says, "I'm a benevolent Elfy Elf Overlord."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Elaejia says, "Hmm, you'll need a herald with strong lungs."
</p><p>Casil asks, "Where's Rillarie?"
</p><p>Casil says, "She's good at yelling."
</p><p>Casil says, "Okay, I think this may be everyone who is joining us."
</p><p>Casil says, "Thanks everyone for joining us today! I won't be having a sign up list for questions, but hold your questions til the end since there's a lot to cover.  We'll go by the good old-fashioned handraising."
</p><p>Casil says, "So, the meeting we held in 2022 had a few main requests on it.  The first was that roleplay be more immersive and meaningful.  The second comment on roleplay was that you were looking for roleplay that brought us together rather than split us apart or set us against other groups."
</p><p>Casil says, "By 2022, I mean at the end of 2022, so for last year."
</p><p>Casil says, "We may have missed the mark with some of the conflict that stirred up with the storyline going on at the time of the meeting, so we did exit as gracefully from that as possible in early 2023 to protect your interests, since I know a great deal of you had concerns with it."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "Sup homies."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven, Celefindel says, "Sah dude."
</p><p>Casil says, "After that, we focused on two main storylines--one involving Yasrenila Compound, where we saw the community band together.  I will be wrapping the end of that up most likely in March.  I apologize for the delay in it--it was slated for September, but I unfortunately caught COVID, and it threw off my time table on that bit.  At this point, it's most logical to release it in the spring, to better show off your flowers."
</p><p>Casil says, "It's still coming though, I promise."
</p><p>Casil says, "The second was the first part of Opportunistic Strife, which allowed you all to work together to keep the road and port safe.  There's more to come in this storyline in the coming year, which we'll touch on soon.  That one also got a little pushed out from the COVID, but the ball is rolling again now."
</p><p>Casil says, "Another request was around the Festival of the Fallen, which the schedule changed for.  Players did organize something for it anyway, and we offered NPC support at the event."
</p><p>Casil says, "You can look forward to it this year, though."
</p><p>Speaking to Thandiwe, Casil asks, "Right? That is this year?"
</p><p>Casil says, "There was commentary about reviewing fighting pit mechanics.  That's still being reviewed."
</p><p>Casil says, "A player also requested the bakery be updated, which was done early 2023, with all new goods, a patio, and a new look for Sweethen."
</p><p>Casil says, "Other updates since the last meeting included some new weapon types at the weaponry, the addition of the Woodman's Chisel in the Ravelin--thanks to GM Elysani--and a further update the other day to add some backroom inventory and an NPC that customize your wood, stone, and bone items."
</p><p>Casil says, "A message board was adding to King's Court, you can now sit on the bench, and the room description got a little bit of an update."
</p><p>Casil says, "We also got a host of citizenship titles, which I see some of you are wearing."
</p><p>Casil says, "Nearly all bugs are closed for Ta'Vaalor--just a couple of obscure creature bugs remain to be reviewed by Dev.  We fixed that SALUTE bug this morning, for Vaalor culture."
</p><p>Casil says, "On the topic of bugs, although it wasn't technically a bug, we did get a report that the Fishing Pier in Ravelin did not actually let you fish, so that was also updated, and includes a fire."
</p><p>Casil says, "I believe it was used recently in a tournament."
</p><p>Lissaya whispers aloud, "It's still bugged for some of us."
</p><p>Speaking to Lissaya, Casil asks, "Did you lose the contest?"
</p><p>Casil says, "Overall, we've worked to include more pop-up RP opportunities in Ta'Vaalor over the year, to help the place feel more alive."
</p><p>Casil says, "A side note on that--I check frequently for people to interact with. If you are in a private home or latched room, I will not be able to pop in to play with you."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven, Tylanthriel says, "Look."
</p><p>Casil says, "I also won't bug you at a table, even though that is NOT private. I assume you're AFK."
</p><p>Speaking to Tylanthriel, Xavanna says, "I said NOTHING."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven to Xavanna, Tylanthriel says, "I've been better."
</p><p>Casil says, "In addition, we had some extra RP opportunities for Ta'Vaalor last year with Nations on the Brink."
</p><p>Casil says, "Namely, Jaddy's unfortunate detainment and his turn in the inquisition."
</p><p>Casil says, "Last, although this has nothing to do with me, we've continued to have great community engagement from our players.  Thank you so much to everyone who hosts events in Ta'Vaalor, whether it's solo or with your MHOs."
</p><p>Casil says, "We have the regular warcamping and Wyvern Wednesdays, and I believe there was a player-run storyline done early last year."
</p><p>Casil says, "I hope you will all continue--and that more of you will feel inspired to run events."
</p><p>Casil says, "Okay. So next year..."
</p><p>Casil asks, "Or this year, rather. What year is it?"
</p><p>Elaejia says, "The year of the chicken."
</p><p>Thandiwe patiently says, "It is year of the Clockwerke Device."
</p><p>Casil says, "This year, I'll be buttoning up Yasrenila Compound, which will include all the submissions from the Yasrenila Compound Decor Contest."
</p><p>Casil says, "Clockwerke Chickens."
</p><p>Casil says, "Again, that'll be in March just for logical purposes."
</p><p>Casil says, "And again, sorry for the delay."
</p><p>Casil says, "I will never leave my house again so I will not catch COVID again."
</p><p>Casil says, "As we continue down the path of Opportunistic Strife, we'll get some firsthand exposure to the Council of Regents, which I know has been a mystery for a long time."
</p><p>Casil says, "I'm looking to build out some lore around it, and with it, the original noble families that have been so mysterious."
</p><p>Casil says, "The main goal for this year will be infrastructure improvements in Ta'Vaalor, including Neartofar Road and Aradhul Road. It's time for Ta'Vaalor to be the city-state it's meant to be and reestablish itself as a true power in its own borders."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven, Tylanthriel says, "Ooooo."
</p><p>Casil says, "We'll see a resolution to the treaty issues with Ta'Illistim in the coming months, too. And some roleplay around it."
</p><p>Casil says, "...Maybe."
</p><p>Elysani murmurs, "Maybe."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Teveriel says, "Music to my ears."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Gotta run. Thanks all."
</p><p>Teveriel clarifies, "The line before the treaty issues, I mean."
</p><p>Casil says, "With that, there may also be some infrastructure improvements within the fortress, too."
</p><p>Casil says, "It's occurred to me recently that the city itself does not reflect perhaps what the general perception is of what a massive, walled, medieval-style fortress city would look like."
</p><p>Casil says, "Many of the room descriptions read more like a suburb outside the city."
</p><p>Casil says, "So, I'll look into some improvements there to make it feel more like the most populous city-state, while preserving its identity and being mindful around private properties."
</p><p>Casil says, "That may be a stretch goal for this year, but I wanted to bring it up incase I start on it slowly."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "Love that."
</p><p>Casil says, "I just noticed not too long ago, there's just...an awful lot of cottages around."
</p><p>Casil says, "When it really should be more like multifamily residences, flats, etc."
</p><p>Casil says, "Manses."
</p><p>Casil says, "Another opportunity for this year will involve the mysterious tower on Sorcerer's Isle."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Teveriel says, "Built out of real sorcerers."
</p><p>Casil says, "You spoiled it already."
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Xavanna says, "Locally sourced."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "They had it coming."
</p><p>Elysani says, "Farm to table."
</p><p>Celefindel says, "One sorceror per brick. Free range, soul fed."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "Well, this took a turn..."
</p><p>Lissaya says, "I just came out to have a good time and I'm feeling very attacked right now."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "Trafficking with demons carries -dire consequences-."
</p><p>Casil says, "Okay... So, Sorcerer's Isle aside..."
</p><p>Casil says, "I have more shop refreshes coming down the pipe."
</p><p>Casil says, "There's a lot of outdated things, like the jewelry shop, for example, that could use some sprucing."
</p><p>Casil says, "We'll have the community greenhouse incoming, and Oirisu's shop."
</p><p>Casil says, "Right now we just have the one NPC that customizes things, in part because all of Ta'Vaalor's shop NPCs are already dedicated to newbie quests."
</p><p>Casil says, "So I need to do a little extra work to get the other options available."
</p><p>Uniana says, "I'm donating them."
</p><p>Casil says, "Oh."
</p><p>Casil says, "I'll also finish Mistwatch fishing this year."
</p><p>Casil says, "I had to take a break from fish after I created hundreds last year."
</p><p>Celefindel says, "That's bribery. We all saw it."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Casil, Rillarie says, "Yes -please-."
</p><p>Speaking to Rillarie, Elaejia says, "Those fish arent gonna catch themselves."
</p><p>Casil says, "Last, I'm looking to do some TV-specific lore regarding the forest gnomes of the city-state."
</p><p>Casil says, "So look forward to that, as well."
</p><p>Casil says, "Oh, and very last, this year I'll be reviewing some partial citizenship changes."
</p><p>Casil says, "No changes will be made without a storyline involved."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Teveriel asks, "More than just the Yasrenila Greengair?"
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Casil exclaims, "Stop spoiling things!"
</p><p>Casil says, "I'm aiming for two updates."
</p><p>Teveriel asks, "Angryhomies?"
</p><p>Casil says, "All right. That's all I had for you that I'm willing to share."
</p><p>Casil says, "Questions, comments, hopes and dreams, emotional outbursts? Raise your hands."
</p><p>Kakoon asks, "For the council of reagents, well we be seeing the ones previously introduced returning or all new ones?"
</p><p>Casil says, "It'll likely be new, since there's no record I have of previous ones introduced."
</p><p>Kakoon says, "Post 2337 on the old forums references some."
</p><p>Casil says, "So it would not behoove me to attempt to play them."
</p><p>Casil says, "It'll be new. I just do not have enough information on them staff-side."
</p><p>Casil says, "It will also not be the whole council."
</p><p>Speaking to Kakoon, Casil asks, "Any other questions?"
</p><p>Kakoon says, "Already answered my other one."
</p><p>Uniana asks, "Two things - is that because there are shadow council members or just taking time to find a good spot for them all?"
</p><p>Teveriel says, "Shadow council sounds so foreboding."
</p><p>Uniana asks, "Second thing, does Clockwerke Device year and Vaalor beautification mean some love for the enclave?"
</p><p>Speaking to Uniana, Casil says, "I could not confirm or deny shadow council members, but it is just taking some time."
</p><p>Speaking to Uniana, Casil says, "Love for the Enclave is definitely on the agenda for some infrastructure or shop additions/refreshes."
</p><p>Casil says, "We'll see how that evolves as the year goes on, too, with the Clockwerke Device theme."
</p><p>Casil says, "I don't want to forget our Burghal gnomies and only focus on our Greengair gnomies."
</p><p>Casil says, "A lot of commentary from last year focused on the EN being TOO elfy, so I am trying to maintain a balance there of exploring some other residents."
</p><p>Casil says, "While still being the elfy elfs."
</p><p>Xavanna sings soulfully:
</p><p>    "Rolling with the gnomies"
</p><p>Teveriel reasons, "Angryhomies."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "Sorry. I couldn't help myself."
</p><p>Casil says, "I honestly had a lot of fun with the gnomes last year and look forward to a little more expansion this year."
</p><p>Casil says, "Our forest cousins."
</p><p>Casil says, "Okay, Tylanthriel was next."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven, Tylanthriel says, "I've seen a fair amount of gnome players recently so that's cool to lookforward too."
</p><p>Rillarie quietly says, "I just started to read their lores, that'll be fun to see."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven, Tylanthriel says, "Is there any thought towards hunting grounds? I know it's a lot but there is a lack of capped undead in the EN. I know HW is "close" but..."
</p><p>Casil says, "I have thoughts and some plans, but hunting ground requests are often backed up, so I don't want to make any promises for this year."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven, Tylanthriel says, "Understood."
</p><p>Casil says, "I have two concerns there. One is that we have a gap in the middle that drives people to Ta'Illistim or to the west, and sometimes it's hard to get them back."
</p><p>Casil says, "And one is that yes, we could use some undead something or other capped out here."
</p><p>Casil says, "One of those is easier to fix than the other."
</p><p>Casil says, "(The easier one being the gap)."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven, Tylanthriel says, "Undead greengair, just putting it out there...again."
</p><p>Casil says, "But both are on my longterm plan list."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven, Tylanthriel says, "I jest."
</p><p>Avawren says, "That gap was a struggle for me when I stubbornly decided to never leave TV. It was tagging along in warcamps and gem bounties for ages."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven, Tylanthriel says, "But thank you."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "I had the same problem and ended up just relocating the character to Sol."
</p><p>Tylanthriel says, "Also sorry I was in elven."
</p><p>Casil says, "Yeah, I spent a lot of time in Ta'Illistim and then random places in the west."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven to Tylanthriel, Laermeluion says, "Maybe we find out the Greengair are actually a terrorist cell we've inadvertantly helped set up their basecamp..."
</p><p>Casil exclaims, "Nonsense!"
</p><p>Teveriel says, "I just used the Chronomage day pass for the only alt I hunt with any real frequency. It IS a somewhat cumbersome solution, though, in ways."
</p><p>Avawren says, "There's also an effective gap around the second ring of the Red Forest, because it's ... kind of unplayable with the stacking RT."
</p><p>Casil says, "I'm looking into solutions for those gaps and just general convenience of getting to hunting grounds. Which I know may seem less important than a capped ground, but... it's also something I can do quickly in comparison."
</p><p>Casil says, "I have already started talking about capped grounds, though, with someone."
</p><p>Avawren says, "Keeping our newbies is very important, in my opinion."
</p><p>Celefindel says, "As an uncapped player who will be hitting those gaps this year, I greatly appreciate it. Accessability for players who haven't been playing since the 80's is vital to game health."
</p><p>Casil says, "So, someday. Just no date yet. Again, it's a long list of towns waiting for hunting grounds."
</p><p>Tylanthriel says, "They have equal importance in my mind, one is just more selfish of course."
</p><p>Casil asks, "Any other questions before Laerme's turn?"
</p><p>Speaking to Laermeluion, Casil exclaims, "You're up!"
</p><p>Laermeluion asks, "When you mention the sizing up of the fortress, will that mostly be in updating room descriptions to give the look more gradeur, or will there be actual expansion of the footprint?"
</p><p>Laermeluion asks, "And how big do you see Ta'Vaalor being?"
</p><p>Laermeluion says, "We aren't talking Gondor big I'm assuming."
</p><p>Casil says, "So, the Ta'Vaalor you can see is only a very, very small portion of the city."
</p><p>Casil says, "Those like 4 roads you can access..."
</p><p>Speaking to Laermeluion, Teveriel says, "Minas Tirith all up ins."
</p><p>Kakoon says, "Can't get lost in a box."
</p><p>Speaking to Kakoon, Casil says, "Tell that to my cat."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Depends on the size of the box."
</p><p>Casil says, "There'd be dozens of streets between them... we just don't actually have access."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "I'm glad TV is starting to think outside the box."
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Laermeluion says, "That's the one I was thinking of, not Gondor as a whole."
</p><p>Casil says, "Ta'Vaalor was meant to be pretty big. It's the most populous city-state in canon lore."
</p><p>Casil says, "Early in its introduction, it was made clear this was just a tiny portion described."
</p><p>Laermeluion asks, "More than Ta'Illistim?"
</p><p>Casil says, "Bigger than TI in footprint, I can't say. It is the most populous though."
</p><p>Casil says, "Gotta support our massive military somehow."
</p><p>Teveriel asks, "Well, a fair portion of that likely lives outside the city proper, too, yeah?"
</p><p>Casil says, "Likely."
</p><p>Elaejia confusedly says, "I need a picture of what it looks like in your heads, i don't know what it is except a box that says "warning contains elves"."
</p><p>Speaking to Elaejia, Teveriel says, "Google Carcassonne, and that's how I see it, personally."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "I'm sure everyone has their own headcanons."
</p><p>Speaking to Elaejia, Xavanna says, "That's pretty accurate."
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Casil says, "That's actually fairly close to what's in my head."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven to Teveriel, Vellani says, "Oh me too that's exactly what i had in mind."
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Elaejia asks, "So in that pictured fortress, where is KC, just as an example?"
</p><p>Casil says, "Probably more expansive, but general look... yes."
</p><p>Lissaya says, "TIL Carcassonne is not just a board game."
</p><p>Tylanthriel says, "Oh that's cool."
</p><p>Casil says, "Ta'Vaalor was meant to be a rather large fortress city, it's just tiny because it was designed to be THE newbie town."
</p><p>Speaking to Elaejia, Laermeluion says, "The big semi-circle."
</p><p>Casil says, "So, to circle back to Laerme's question--initially I just want to update some of the room descriptions to be a little less suburbia and a little more urban."
</p><p>Casil says, "I hesitate to actually add to the footprint."
</p><p>Casil says, "For one, we've got the built-in map and that'll destroy that."
</p><p>Casil says, "Second, we're pretty small and probably don't need the extra space."
</p><p>Speaking to Laermeluion, Teveriel says, "Except.. moar green."
</p><p>Tylanthriel asks, "I guess we use...our imagination?"
</p><p>Rillarie quietly says, "Absurd, sir."
</p><p>Casil says, "Imagination in a text game. Imagine that."
</p><p>Speaking monotonously to Tylanthriel, Teveriel says, "Mind blown."
</p><p>Speaking to Tylanthriel, Laermeluion says, "There's some truffels out in the toadwort good for that."
</p><p>Speaking to Laermeluion, Casil asks, "Did that answer your question?"
</p><p>Speaking to Uniana, Casil says, "You're up."
</p><p>Speaking to Laermeluion, Teveriel says, "But those have the unwanted side effect of making you spout haiku."
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Casil asks, "Is that an UNWANTED side effect?"
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Xavanna says, "Beat me to it."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Teveriel says, "Quite fond of tubers."
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Laermeluion says, "But a possible side effect of getting a katana...if that's still active."
</p><p>Uniana asks, "Can we expect to see documents like TN and TL for TV and TI?"
</p><p>Casil asks, "Ladies?"
</p><p>Xynwen says, "I mean, I want to."
</p><p>Casil says, "I do, too."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "So...yes."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I don't see why that wouldn't happen."
</p><p>Thandiwe asks, "Though, to be fair, doesn't TV already have one?"
</p><p>Teveriel says, "The TL and TN documentation are both so rich."
</p><p>Laermeluion asks, "TN TL?"
</p><p>Casil says, "It has one but it could be expanded on."
</p><p>Lissaya whispers aloud, "More flora."
</p><p>Speaking in Elven, Agathilea says, "It's not expansive."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Ta'Nalfein and Ta'Loenthra."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Laermeluion, Rillarie mouths, "Thank you!"
</p><p>Avawren says, "I go back to read the TN doc and see things I somehow missed regularly, it's so stuffed with detail. I'd love to see Vaalor have similiar."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "If these two will let me, I want to do Ta'Ashrim "as it was" too."
</p><p>Casil says, "It covers some things like marriage and...being in the military..."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "Yes, not Tennessee."
</p><p>Speaking to Thandiwe, Tylanthriel says, "You type too fast. I misspelled them twice."
</p><p>Thandiwe asks, "What?"
</p><p>Laermeluion says, "Oh."
</p><p>Speaking to Tylanthriel, Thandiwe asks, "What do you mean?"
</p><p>Speaking to Tylanthriel, Xeraphina says, "We're revoking your elf card."
</p><p>Teveriel asks, "You guys have cards?"
</p><p>Speaking to Thandiwe, Uniana says, "The richness and depth of the TL/TN gives us all kinds of thematic elements that aren't really present for the existing towns."
</p><p>Tylanthriel says, "I may also have 13 stiches in my left wrist...."
</p><p>Casil says, "I did realize, as I was building my customizing NPC, that TV really doesn't have a lot of unique flora and fauna like the other cities."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Ah."
</p><p>Uniana says, "Before for Nalfein we had fans and black roses."
</p><p>Uniana says, "Now we have all kinds of flora, fauna, architecture, etc."
</p><p>Casil says, "Ta'Vaalor at the moment has gold/crimson, wyverns, and dragonstalks."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Just wait for TA..."
</p><p>Speaking to Xeraphina, Xavanna says, "He gets a pass. It was just last night."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I'm so rediculously excited about it."
</p><p>Casil says, "It could use some fleshing out."
</p><p>Teveriel asks, "But what could be better than wyverns and dragonstalks?"
</p><p>Speaking cheerfully to Thandiwe, Rillarie exclaims, "I am, I am!"
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Casil says, "Armored chickens."
</p><p>Speaking to Thandiwe, Uniana whines, "U so mean."
</p><p>Speaking to Uniana, Casil asks, "Anything else?"
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Elaejia says, "And lasimor, but it's locked in rare fodder jail."
</p><p>Avawren says, "We are also excited."
</p><p>Speaking to Dariya, Casil exclaims, "You're up!"
</p><p>Speaking to Elaejia, Casil says, "Aqilorn."
</p><p>Meril says, "Black roltons."
</p><p>Casil says, "But that's not an identity so much as the other things are."
</p><p>Elaejia says, "Broadly available cultural materials are rad and it has been great to see them in the TN and TL lore expansion."
</p><p>Kakoon asks, "Maybe something more on Yander and why they own so much farm?"
</p><p>Dariya says, "I know it's a port town, but is there any possibility of adding Chronomage access to Nielira Harbor and being able to get a Chronomage day pass there, like we can access Ta'illistim?  Since it's fairly close by."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "Aqilorn lost its luster a little after figuring out it was an anagram of Qalinor."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "For me, anyway."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "Just a little, though."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "We are not adding Chronomage access to the ports."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "Still going to turn it into a Fabulous gown, though."
</p><p>Casil says, "That's outside my scope, but I'd say you can use the harbormaster to get there instead."
</p><p>Casil says, "Oh, Thandiwe answered for me."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "There is a stable there and you can access from OSA.  We do need to keep some of those system with unique offerings."
</p><p>Avawren says, "Since it has become a tradition that I bring this up every OOC meeting ..."
</p><p>Uniana whispers aloud, "Bathhouse."
</p><p>Casil says, "On my todo."
</p><p>Avawren says, "Could we have the mystery of the hidden ... yes, bathhouse."
</p><p>Casil says, "I didn't mention it because I am not sure if I can manage it this year or not."
</p><p>Avawren asks, "It drives me crazy! What's behind those arches??"
</p><p>Speaking to Avawren, Casil says, "Devastatingly handsome elves."
</p><p>Speaking to Avawren, Teveriel says, "The secret Angryhomie sweatshop."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Avawren exclaims, "I know that's why I want in!"
</p><p>Speaking to Elysani, Casil asks, "How many times have I mentioned the bathhouse in the past two weeks?"
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Elysani says, "Many, I want one in TN too."
</p><p>Speaking to Avawren, Tylanthriel says, "I'm right here."
</p><p>Casil says, "I'll count it as a stretch goal for this year."
</p><p>Speaking to Avawren, Celefindel asks, "Wait you haven't been through the arches???"
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Celefindel asks, "Is that just an us thing???"
</p><p>Casil says, "I'm also a student, so sometimes I don't have as much time as I'd like to make things happen."
</p><p>Speaking to Celefindel, Teveriel says, "Shh."
</p><p>Lissaya murmurs, "I ship it."
</p><p>Casil says, "I'd rather underpromise and overdeliver and all that."
</p><p>Casil asks, "Anyone else?"
</p><p>Speaking to Uniana, Casil exclaims, "I asked if you had more questions!"
</p><p>Lissaya asks, "Chances of new bugs or sea life for Mistwatch? Instead of the Vaalor area ones?"
</p><p>Casil says, "I'll put it on the request list."
</p><p>Lissaya exclaims, "Good enough for me!"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Apologies, I glanced away, on emoment."
</p><p>Thandiwe asks, "Oh, is this bugs and sea critters?"
</p><p>Casil says, "It's possible. I just didn't have it planned for this year."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "That can be updated pretty much at any point.  But its a lot of work.  We've created approximately 2,000+ unique bugs and about 5-600 sea critters."
</p><p>Agathilea informs, "Looking for a shrimp with a visage similar to a wyvern.  Red and gold.  flutters through the water seamlessly at a rapid pace."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "After a while, you just start seeing spider.. spider... barnacle... barnacle."
</p><p>Elysani says, "Delicious seapony snacks."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I mean, we can get it on a list but I can't make any promises."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "More crusty bois."
</p><p>Speaking to Uniana, Casil says, "You're up."
</p><p>Uniana says, "Okay well now I have two."
</p><p>Speaking quietly to Tivvy, Rillarie says, "It's okay.  It's all okay."
</p><p>Uniana asks, "Are the baby wyverns that were released at Qalinor's coronation still out there? Or...was that just hand-wavy retcon magic?"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Whaa..."
</p><p>Elysani says, "They're hiding behind that arch."
</p><p>Agathilea asks, "Baby wyverns?"
</p><p>Speaking to Elysani, Teveriel says, "They heat the baths."
</p><p>Casil says, "Uh, I think I'd have to look into those."
</p><p>Speaking to Uniana, Casil asks, "Were they actual items or ... just messaging?"
</p><p>Rillarie firmly says, "We have to get in there."
</p><p>Agathilea asks, "They exist?"
</p><p>Uniana says, "It was like messaging. They were in cages and then released and started flying together out into the wild."
</p><p>Uniana says, "Crimson ones, obviously."
</p><p>Uniana says, "Okay so I'll let you all think about that while I move on."
</p><p>Casil says, "Yes, please."
</p><p>Teveriel asks, "It was the wild west back then. Can we just call it a fun illusion?"
</p><p>Casil says, "Illusion prop."
</p><p>Vellani says, "They were clockwerke."
</p><p>Speaking to Elysani, Teveriel says, "Now I want that illusion."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "Me too."
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Elysani asks, "That you're a baby wyvern?"
</p><p>Speaking to Uniana, Casil asks, "Second question?"
</p><p>Uniana asks, "So we're not the smallest community but we are far from the biggest, which I'm fine with. Quality over quantity to me. And even still on a good WW we get like 15-20 people with visitors. But is that a concern for you Casil, as guru or the world team as a whole? How do you measure the health of a community?"
</p><p>Uniana says, "SORRY I HAD A BIG ONE."
</p><p>Speaking to Elysani, Teveriel ventures, "Gotta love me."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "Good question."
</p><p>Casil says, "So, I'll answer first, then let Thandiwe answer for the world team."
</p><p>Casil says, "Right now, I'm actually fine with our current size when we hold events.  I would like a little more day-to-day activity, which is one of the measurements I use for the health of the community."
</p><p>Rillarie cheerfully says, "I might be coming to help with that."
</p><p>Rillarie says, "Or at least, in this region..."
</p><p>Casil says, "I see up to about 25 at my events, depending on who is running it and what we're doing."
</p><p>Speaking to Uniana, Casil says, "Igges is a popular guy."
</p><p>Uniana says, "It's really Spike."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "I wasn't going to say it."
</p><p>Teveriel confirms, "But it's Spike."
</p><p>Casil says, "I think we've seen some improvement in the health of the community over the past year."
</p><p>Casil says, "Personally. I feel like you have all worked really hard to be inclusive and get rid of the perception that we are NOT an inclusive community."
</p><p>Casil says, "And I know that was one of my goals as well, but it ultimately comes down to all of you, and I've seen so much welcoming behavior."
</p><p>Casil says, "And you handled it really well when there was some conflict at the beginning of the year."
</p><p>Casil says, "I'll continue evaluating the health of the community as Elysani ramps up in Ta'Illistim."
</p><p>Elysani says, "I'll be building my army of wyverns up."
</p><p>Elysani says, "Wyverns versus peahens."
</p><p>Tivvy says, "That sounds like a board game."
</p><p>Laermeluion says, "You thought Griffin season was bad, wait till the wyverns are plucking adventurer's off the road."
</p><p>Speaking to Elysani, Avawren says, "The maedat would like a piece of this, as is their nature."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "I'm not sure why there would be any kind of concern on the populace of an area.  We have classifications of Towns/Cities and they are broken up by Major, Minor, and Community.  A community, for example, is Ravelin, Sylvaerrend, Brisker's Cove, and Naelira, while a minor town is Cysaegir, River's Rest, Teras Isle, Zul Logoth, which leaves Ta'Vaalor, Ta'Illistim, Wehnimer's Landing, Icemule Trace, and Solhaven as Major cities.  You'll notice that starting towns fall into that category.  There really isn't anything to worry about regards to populations.  One of our underlying goals is to build up the east to ensure that we have a balance and everyday I see more and more people coming to this side of the Spine for RP and events and fun."
</p><p>(OOC) You quietly whisper to Tivvy, "We need that board game."
</p><p>Casil says, "Right now, my biggest concern is continuing to draw roleplayers to the Nations."
</p><p>Thandiwe asks, "Was there a particular concern you had regarding the populace of Ta'Vaalor?"
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "Kraken's Fall is also considered a minor town."
</p><p>Uniana says, "Me? Heck no. But like I certainly see the people throw little jabs here and there about the population and like while it doesn't matter at all to I think the majority of us here, I'm interested in the internal metrics about what makes a major town just that and considered thriving etc."
</p><p>Laermeluion says, "I think most think of populace as just the PC's."
</p><p>Laermeluion says, "Like the crimson legion is just us reservists..."
</p><p>Speaking to Laermeluion, Teveriel says, "I see that a lot."
</p><p>Thandiwe says, "People are going to make jabs left and right no matter what.  If it isn't a jab at elves, then its a jab at humans, if it isn't a jab about conflict, then its a jab about peace.  I'd just tune it out as the goal of the World Team is to provide opportunities across the breadth of Elanthia that cater to all players."
</p><p>Speaking to Uniana, Avawren asks, "How many times have been called "dead"?"
</p><p>Uniana says, "I still play Starcraft 2 sometimes. Don't come at me about dead games."
</p><p>Casil says, "Yeah, the jabs you're referring to, I have seen."
</p><p>Casil says, "From my side, I am not worried about the size of Ta'Vaalor's active player base or the engagement in our activities."
</p><p>Laermeluion says, "Ta'Vaalor isn't dead until it's just Orssus sitting in court all by himself..."
</p><p>Casil says, "We've a quality group, and that's all that matters."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "Thinking on a broad scope is easier said than done when one only plays in one area.  We have a strong core group."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "That is balance for us."
</p><p>Casil says, "And I think we will see more engagement in this year in the EN in general."
</p><p>Elysani says, "As someone who just visits the sandbox on occasion, I think the community here has really done a great job staying a community."
</p><p>Casil says, "We've got a guru on each town now."
</p><p>Lissaya says, "I thought it was the same person."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "I mean, Oirisu just got her own shop in Mistwatch."
</p><p>Casil says, "Well, Cysaegir has Xeraphina."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "So you'd better keep visiting this sandbox."
</p><p>Casil says, "Only Elysani and I are the same person."
</p><p>Casil asks, "Okay, any other questions about Ta'Vaalor?"
</p><p>Elysani says, "Yeah, you're stuck with laptop Casil."
</p><p>Speaking to Elysani, Avawren says, "Dressed as an armored chicken."
</p><p>Yunni says, "Well not a question."
</p><p>Casil says, "Comments are welcome."
</p><p>Yunni says, "I just wanted to take advantage of some of you being here to say I am so grateful for this community. If not for TV I probably would have quit earlier on from some interactions I have had earlier on when I first started around looking for where I fit in. I'm ridiculously shy even behind text with no real rp experience and spending time in TV has really helped me open up."
</p><p>Speaking to Yunni, Xeraphina says, "We're super glad you stuck with us."
</p><p>Casil says, "Well, then kudos to the TV community."
</p><p>Speaking to Yunni, Casil says, "I'm glad you stuck around."
</p><p>Speaking to Yunni, Uniana says, "We can hug it out but only this once."
</p><p>Casil says, "And honestly, that is one of the things I love about us having a smaller community... we ARE a great place to come when you are new."
</p><p>Teveriel exclaims, "Quick! Take advantage of the OOC!"
</p><p>Yunni says, "No take backs."
</p><p>Speaking to Yunni, Avawren says, "Years ago I had the same experience, I'm so glad to hear we've kept up the tradition."
</p><p>Speaking to Yunni, Agathilea asks, "You have to stay with us, I mean who else are we going to try to beat in the fishing contests?"
</p><p>Speaking to Yunni, Celefindel says, "Heck yeah, newbies unite."
</p><p>Casil says, "I will say, I have watched you all interacting with various new players over the past few months."
</p><p>Speaking to Yunni, Laermeluion says, "Oh, so that group intro was probably a bit heavy."
</p><p>Casil says, "And the way you have pulled together, helped them learn how to play, supplied them with goods, and just RPed with them..."
</p><p>Casil says, "I'm pretty sure I bragged about you in Discord to these folks."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "Celefindel and Yunni are two primo examples of TV noobs, and I'm glad to have been able to interact with them."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Tivvy says, "It gives me the happies."
</p><p>Lissaya whispers aloud, "Shiiiip it."
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Celefindel says, "Captain my Captain."
</p><p>Casil asks, "Okay, so any other dire questions or comments?"
</p><p>Avawren says, "It only tried for like ... five years to rope him in proper. It was you guys that reeled him in."
</p><p>Speaking to Celefindel, Teveriel exclaims, "You, sir, are a fish!"
</p><p>Ilthorn says, "I enjoy fishing morning and through out the day can the rate of reely a fish in and different kind get better."
</p><p>Teveriel remarks, "A muskie, I reckon. Nice."
</p><p>Ilthorn says, "I am lucky if i reely one in."
</p><p>Speaking to Teveriel, Celefindel says, "You don't know the half of it."
</p><p>Casil says, "Ah, fishing is a universal system."
</p><p>Casil says, "There are factors that can impact the success."
</p><p>Rillarie cheerfully asks, "Someone point me to the nearest fishing hole here, please?  For afters?"
</p><p>Casil says, "I do not know the details of it, though."
</p><p>Speaking to Rillarie, Avawren says, "Several steps south there is a dock, and a fishing shack."
</p><p>Speaking to Ilthorn, Laermeluion says, "You should speak with Iskandr, he fishes a lot."
</p><p>Casil says, "My guess is it's because it's winter."
</p><p>Laermeluion says, "He's been around here recently, but he's a late riser."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "There are a few."
</p><p>Speaking appreciatively to Avawren, Rillarie says, "Thank you, perfect."
</p><p>Teveriel says, "The fishing pier at the Ravelin was recently updated."
</p><p>Casil says, "If I recall from the player wiki, fishing has different bonuses during different seasons."
</p><p>Speaking to Laermeluion, Ilthorn says, "I saw him last night at a camp fire along the road to the port."
</p><p>Casil says, "So you may just be suffering from it being the winter."
</p><p>Speaking to Rillarie, Teveriel says, "We keep the Spirit of the Mists open in Mistwatch. You can do some oceanic fishing there as well, anytime."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "It has slowed some for me."
</p><p>Casil says, "Okay. With that, I'm going to close it out."
</p><p>Ilthorn says, "I not seen or heard of one reeling in a legendary fish is there a special spot."
</p><p>Casil says, "I have one final thing to say..."
</p><p>Casil says, "Which is just a big thank you to this entire community and all of our visitors."
</p><p>Casil says, "I appreciate your patience with me as I continue to grow into this role, your fantastic commitment to Ta'Vaalor, and the EN in general."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Avawren says, "We are lucky to have you."
</p><p>Speaking sincerely to Casil, Agathilea says, "Thank you.  You have put a lot of work in already, and we appreciate you."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Celefindel says, "You've been fantastic, and super inclusive, and all your efforts with me during spooky season were an absolute blast. So thank you too."
</p><p>Casil says, "Trust me, I feel the same way about y'all."
</p><p>Speaking to Elysani, Teveriel says, "And you."
</p><p>Speaking to Celefindel, Casil says, "Oh, God, I had so much fun with you."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "Even though you target some of us...."
</p><p>Casil says, "Easy target."
</p><p>Agathilea says, "Three times."
</p><p>Casil says, "Thank you for your engagement."
</p><p>Casil says, "I look forward to the next year."
</p><p>Elaejia exclaims, "Thank you for everything, it's going to be a great year!"
</p><p>Casil says, "Especially with Elysani across the way."
</p><p>Casil says, "And maybe Xeraphina."
</p><p>Casil says, "I think we're going to have a great year in the EN as a whole."
</p><p>Ilthorn says, "Off to fish thank you."
</p><p>Laermeluion says, "Thanks for everything you've done so far."
</p><p>Rillarie happily says, "Hope to see more of you as I meander about the lands."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Tylanthriel says, "Thank you for all you do."
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Tivvy, "See you!"
</p><p>Laermeluion says, "Looking forward to the year."
</p><p>Tylanthriel says, "And for the rest of the GMs, thank you."
</p><p>Rillarie quietly says, "And yes, thank you -very- much GMs."
</p><p>Xavanna says, "What Ty said."
</p><p>Teveriel abruptly exclaims, "PEACE!"
</p><p>Xeraphina exclaims, "Have a good day!"
</p><p>Vellani exclaims, "Thank you all!"
