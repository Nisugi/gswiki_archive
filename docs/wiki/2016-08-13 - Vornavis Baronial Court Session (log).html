You peer out and see ...

[Solhaven, Esplanade Gate]
A swan of white ora sits on the green copper gates, proclaiming them an entrance into Vornavis.  Around them stands a huge granite wall, protecting the inhabitants of the city from all intruders.  Citizens move through the gates under the careful eye of the guard standing in front of the portal.  You also see the Irar disk, a pale-faced coppery barn owl that is flying around, the white Hapenlok disk, a brilliant green parrot that is flying around, a gathered crowd of commoners and white-robed priests, a desolate mountain spirit that is flying around, a fickle mountain spirit that is flying around, a roly-poly flamepoint sand kitten, a green-eyed black cat, a joyous solar spirit that is flying around, a reinforced sally gate and a guard.

Stormyrain whispers to the group, "..not everyone in attendance is an Imperial citizen. Many have very little experience in courtly situations. Not to mention the atrocities they have had to watch the Prelate and his Blameless conduct in the name of Koar--well. While I do not support the disruption of the Baron's court, I can understand it."

Speaking to Shannivar, Rovvigen says, "Legit questions."

Chaston peers quizzically at Dunrith.

Speaking to Chaston, Dunrith says, "Such a thing must have been quite the boon given so many of your people were suffering, lacking in food and shelter."

Dunrith says, "Your people were starving and lacked shelter, and you were flush with money from your blood marble."

Shinann smiles quietly to herself.

Chaston says, "It falls to the rulers, the Lords of Hendor, to see to the simple needs of Talador. Surely you must understand such."

Panndoris nods once at Dunrith.

Panndoris stares at Chaston.

Goldstr laughs at Chaston!

Goldstr blushes a glowing shade of red.

Dunrith says, "For one that cares for his people so much, we would think you would do whatever was needed to care for your people."

Goldstr says, "Er pardon please."

Chaston says, "With the opportunities bestowed upon me by the God-King, I have given Talador more important things than just food and sheltar."

Chaston says, "I have given them faith. I have given them a future."

Aurach whispers to the group, "It has been some time since my studies, but I do recall, it being said, that Arkati of light and dark would be face against each other in open warfare, as long as Koar yet lived."

Dunrith says, "And yet when you were prospering with funds, you in turn built a temple."

Aurach narrows his eyes in concentration as he taps his pursed lips idly with one forefinger.
Arrec slowly empties his lungs.

Chaston says, "I have given them purpose."

Panndoris softly says, "Hate is not a purpose."

Ylandra whispers to the group, "The problem is that he is painting the Arkati of the light and of the dark as all being of the dark."

Mikalmas asks, "Wow.  Faith alone will feed and clothe them?"

Dunrith says, "But you did not give them the things they needed most.  The things they needed to survive."

Panndoris sighs.

Rowmi glances uneasily out.

Dunrith says, "Others saw to that."

Risanya mumbles, "And streets that run with blood."

Dunrith says, "Vornavis amongst them."

Goldstr adopts an agreeable expression.

Chaston says, "You are correct."

Speaking to Chaston, Dunrith says, "A Half-Elf gave them what they needed to live."

(Panndoris gazes at Dunrith with pride in his eyes.)

Hadya grins slowly.

Aydan grins slowly.

Hapenlok mutters, "Sounds that way."

Risanya softly says, "And now the snake has shed its skin."

Speaking to Aydan, Mikalmas asks, "Did you expect anything diferent?"

Mohrgan's entire body tenses as he clenches his fist.

Ylandra frowns.

Chaston says, "Because of Talador's debt to Vornavis..."

Chaston says, "Bearing the God-King's stark warning."

Speaking casually to Aydan, Bristenn ventures, "I find it wholly unorthodox, genrally."

Deavon whispers to the group, "I do think Dunrith is holding his own nicely, considering."

Mikalmas says, "How very kind of you."

Mikalmas smirks.

Ordim nods in agreement at Deavon.

Ylandra whispers to the group, "Agreed."

Siierra shakes her head.

Kheltav chuckles to himself.

Mikalmas says, "And I ask, what of the followers of Kai we witnessed you slaughter?  What of them?  They were not Lornon."

Chaston says, "In kind, I have come to help bring sustenance to the soul of your people."

Speaking to Chaston, Dunrith says, "We would say to you that you should see that your own house is in order, before you begin knocking on the doors of others."

Panndoris gently says, "Empty words and threats..."

Panndoris frowns at Chaston.

[Solhaven, Esplanade Gate]
A swan of white ora sits on the green copper gates, proclaiming them an entrance into Vornavis.  Around them stands a huge granite wall, protecting the inhabitants of the city from all intruders.  Citizens move through the gates under the careful eye of the guard standing in front of the portal.  You also see a stooped old woman, some pothinir grass, a fat forest mouse, a pale-faced coppery barn owl that is flying around, a fickle mountain spirit that is flying around, a joyous solar spirit that is flying around, a reinforced sally gate and a guard.
Also here: Roblar, Lady Berrasi, Futtilo
Obvious paths: west

BACK IN THE LANDING

You focus on projecting your thoughts...
You (Focused to Stormyrain) [Local]: "Something has happened to the prisoner."

Stormyrain (Focused) [Local]: "..yes I'm standing here getting report."

Stormyrain (Focused) [Local]: "Come to the Entryway of the barracks if you will."

[Wehnimer's, North Ring Rd.]
The east-west road continues, closed in on the south by the militia barracks and on the north by the twelve-foot-high wall of the city itself.  The occasional thud of leather boots in unison upon cobbled pavement and the clipped shouts of barked orders reverberate off the modwir walls along this part of the road.  The scents of leather, weapon oil and hearty cooking fill the night air.  You also see the town barracks.
Obvious paths: east, west

You take a few steps toward the town barracks.

[Town Barracks, Inner Courtyard]
Stone walls wrap around to form a solid enclosure to the courtyard, the ground smooth and paved with dark cobblestones.  Barely visible beyond the thick iron gate stretches North Ring Road and an expanse of the palisades of Wehnimer's Landing.  A large two-story brick building dominates the far end of the courtyard, its roof topped with a black and grey flag.  You also see a dark wooden table with an iron bucket on it.
Obvious paths: east, west

You pant.

[Town Barracks, Entryway]
The stone floor of the barracks entrance expands out in all directions, its smooth surface marred by numerous boot scuffs.  To the east, through an open archway, the glimmer of metal armor and weapons can be seen, while the clatter and chatter of the dining hall echoes in from the south.  A wide wooden stairwell dominates the western wall, rising up to reach the second floor.  You also see a uniformed Wehnimer's militiaman, a uniformed Wehnimer's militiaman, a uniformed Wehnimer's militiaman and the white Hapenlok disk.
Also here: Stormyrain, Hapenlok
Obvious exits: east, south, out


You feel the blood drain from your face.

Speaking to you, Stormyrain says, "Join Hapenlok. We're waiting for a few others."

Speaking to Stormyrain, Hapenlok says, "I assume responsiblity for this. i have ....no excuse."

Hapenlok says, "I should have been here, instead...i'm there."

(Hapenlok points in the general direction of vornavis.)

You fret.

(Arrec shakes out his hair briefly.)

Speaking to a uniformed Wehnimer's militiaman, Stormyrain says, "We'll discuss that when Thrayzar is back."

A militiaman says, "He kept going on and on, where's the clock where's the clock, tick tock tick tock..."

A militiaman says, "We thought he just fell asleep finally."

Speaking to a uniformed Wehnimer's militiaman, Stormyrain says, "Let's hold apologies until we know what has happened."

(Bristenn casually unlatches the top toggle of his damask tunic, while shifting his gaze gradually over to the gathered militia.)

Bristenn furrows his brow.

Hapenlok carefully straps his backsword to his back-scabbard.  It rattles against the runestaff strapped to it, and he carefully adjusts them.

A militiaman says, "Then we went in to bring him some water and..."

You sigh.

Aydan runs his fingers over the surface of his alabaster silk shirt.  A soft *WHIR* accompanies the metallic gnashing of gears as his shirt transforms into a suit of azure steel-banded platemail.

Shinann just arrived.

Stormyrain slowly empties her lungs.

(Arrec glances between Aydan and Mynon enviously.)

Stormyrain nods slowly.

Aydan says, "Perfect time to tie up that loose end, while everyone was distracted."

Shinann joins Stormyrain's group.
