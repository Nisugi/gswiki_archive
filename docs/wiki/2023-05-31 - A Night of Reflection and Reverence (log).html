<p>[Clovertooth, Auditorium - 29536]
</p><p>Raw cedar timbers perfume the air, comprising the walls of the expansive hall.  Living evergreen boughs contrast frame the southern entrance, brightly illuminated by faceted glimaerstone orbs set high into the ceiling.  The light scatters over a few dozen rows of comfortably padded seats and rugs covering parts of the polished floor.  A central aisle delineated by a quartet of braziers leads toward an expansive cedar and pine stage framed by silver-trimmed blue curtains.  You also see the Lithyia disk.
</p><p>Also here: Jadedragan who is sitting, Lord Grutak, Lady Aliashyrah, Adalfuns who is sitting, Imrys who is sitting, Draelor, Squire Alosaka, Lord Randsford, Lord Sorlu, Lady Teaberry who is sitting, Mistress Lithyia, Lady Opalina
</p><p>Lithyia waves to Sorlu.
</p><p>Opalina gazes heavenward.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Lithyia.
</p><p>Lithyia grins at Opalina.
</p><p>With straightened posture and a firm chin, Sorlu presents himself to Opalina with a short, courteous bow.
</p><p>Teaberry waves to Sorlu.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Opalina, Sorlu says, "Good evening, Councillor."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Teaberry.
</p><p>Teaberry waves to Aliashyrah.
</p><p><b>Opalina says, "Good evening."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu offers a polite nod, touching two fingers against his forehead in a brief salute as he tucks his opposite hand into the bloodjewel-fastened pocket of his obsidian waistcoat.
</p><p>Straightening her back, Aliashyrah gives a formal, low curtsy to Teaberry.  She inclines her head as well, giving Teaberry a brief nod.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "I'm becoming far too casual with Sorlu lately."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia says, "I must do better."
</p><p>Lithyia sinks down in a deep curtsy before Sorlu, her lashes lowered.
</p><p>Lithyia chuckles.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "It's as if im forgetting my manners lately...."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia gazes in wonder at her surroundings.
</p><p><b>Opalina says, "I'd like to think I was the same to most everyone."</b>
</p><p>Lord Randsford just arrived.
</p><p>Randsford nods to Lithyia in greeting.
</p><p>Sorlu grins at Lithyia.
</p><p>Opalina says, "Few folks get extra hugs."
</p><p>Lithyia grins at Opalina.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Lithyia, Sorlu says, "I do not mind. We have become fast friends."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Lithyia.
</p><p>Lithyia nods to Sorlu.
</p><p>Lithyia says, "I agree."
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "I dare say I give everyone the same greeting."
</p><p>Aliashyrah smirks.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "To think, it all started with me calling you spicy."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia smirks at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "Much to some people's dismay."
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles at Lithyia.
</p><p>Aliashyrah glances at Lithyia.
</p><p>Teaberry says, "And you always look graceful."
</p><p>Teaberry nods at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Aliashyrah begins to breathe less deeply.
</p><p>Aliashyrah smiles at Teaberry.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "Sorlu came to a town hall meeting months ago in the Landing."</b>
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "Raised a lot of eyes."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu hums quietly to himself.
</p><p>Speaking demurely to Teaberry, Aliashyrah says, "That is very kind of you to say."
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "After, i called him spicy."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu says, "A few."
</p><p>Lithyia chuckles.
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles.
</p><p>Aliashyrah gazes in amusement at Sorlu.
</p><p>Lithyia says, "And then i made him some spicy knitwear."
</p><p>Lithyia chuckles.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Sorlu, Aliashyrah asks, "Are you spicy?"</b>
</p><p>Sorlu ponders.
</p><p>Speaking to Lithyia, Teaberry asks, "With hot peppers on it?"
</p><p><b>Opalina asks, "Spicy?"</b>
</p><p>Lithyia nods.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "Yes, spicy."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia chuckles.
</p><p>Opalina sniffs at Sorlu.
</p><p><b>Lithyia exclaims, "He had fire!"</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Aliashyrah, Sorlu says, "If it is said by others, who am I to deny it."</b>
</p><p>Opalina lets out a great honking sneeze!
</p><p>Sorlu grins.
</p><p>Lithyia says, "Blessings to you Opalina."
</p><p>Opalina says, "There might be a little pepper on you."
</p><p>Opalina nods to Sorlu.
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles at Opalina.
</p><p>Lithyia giggles.
</p><p>Teaberry waves to Alosaka.
</p><p>Alosaka nods in greeting at Teaberry.
</p><p>Alosaka removes an inky black morduska hide book from in his ivory satchel.
</p><p>You notice Draelor moving stealthily into the room.
</p><p>Alosaka smiles.
</p><p>Lithyia nods to Alosaka in greeting.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Lithyia, Sorlu asks, "Where is the Commander tonight?"</b>
</p><p>Lithyia smiles at Alosaka.
</p><p>Sorlu cocks his head at Lithyia.
</p><p>Alosaka nods respectfully at Lithyia.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "He might not be joining us."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu frowns.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Sorlu, Aliashyrah asks, "Fashionably late as always?"</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Lithyia, Sorlu says, "That's a pity."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah looks thoughtfully at Lithyia.
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Lithyia says, "A...mischeduling of sorts."
</p><p>Lithyia nods.
</p><p>Speaking to Lithyia, Aliashyrah murmurs, "That is a shame."
</p><p><b>Speaking to Aliashyrah, Sorlu says, "As is the way for most in Icemule."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia agrees with Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles.
</p><p>Alosaka notes, "Many folks are occupied in Mist Harbor tonight."
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods at Alosaka.
</p><p>Lithyia waves to Imrys.
</p><p>Lithyia waves to Adalfuns.
</p><p>Alosaka smiles at Imrys.
</p><p>Sorlu rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Alosaka nods at Adalfuns.
</p><p>Imrys inclines her head.
</p><p>Randsford nods to Imrys in greeting.
</p><p>Sorlu nods to Adalfuns in greeting.
</p><p>Adalfuns says, "Hey."
</p><p>Imrys brightly says, "Good evening."
</p><p>Sorlu nods to Imrys in greeting.
</p><p>Adalfuns flashes a quick grin.
</p><p>Imrys grins.
</p><p><b>Adalfuns says, "Quiet tonight."</b>
</p><p>Adalfuns selects an available padded seat and makes his way over to it, quietly taking a spot.
</p><p>Imrys sits down next to Adalfuns.
</p><p>Adalfuns glances suspiciously at Lithyia.
</p><p>Lithyia waves to Draelor.
</p><p>Speaking to Adalfuns, Aliashyrah says, "It seems that the mists call to many."
</p><p>Lithyia glances at Adalfuns.
</p><p>Draelor nods in greeting at Lithyia.
</p><p>Imrys nods slightly.
</p><p>Speaking to Adalfuns, Alosaka says, "Mist Harbor has drawn many away."
</p><p><b>Adalfuns says, "I mostly meant Grutak wasn't here."</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adalfuns, Sorlu says, "Many are elsewhere...we will give them a few more minutes to arrive."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia laughs at Adalfuns!
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Adalfuns.
</p><p>Imrys laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.
</p><p>Alosaka ponders.
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles at Adalfuns.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "Yes...he..had a.."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia says, "Scheduling...conflict."
</p><p><b>Adalfuns suspiciously asks, "An accident?"</b>
</p><p>Lithyia nods.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adalfuns, Sorlu says, "I have heard rumors he will be along in a few."</b>
</p><p>Adalfuns flashes a quick grin.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "So he might not make it tonight."</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adalfuns, Imrys says, "We'll let him know you missed him."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia nods at Imrys.
</p><p>Imrys tenderly pats Adalfuns's hand.
</p><p>Imrys appears to be trying hard not to grin.
</p><p>Alosaka grins at Imrys.
</p><p>Adalfuns says, "Better sell it better if you want it believed."
</p><p><b>Speaking to Imrys, Alosaka says, "How Adalfuns was moping and disconsolate."</b>
</p><p>Adalfuns grins at Alosaka.
</p><p>Imrys agrees with Alosaka.
</p><p>Sorlu grins.
</p><p><b>Imrys says, "Pining."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia chuckles.
</p><p>Imrys surreptitiously glances at Adalfuns.
</p><p>Lithyia says, "Definitely pining."
</p><p>Adalfuns grins at Imrys.
</p><p>Aliashyrah whispers something to Lithyia.
</p><p>Lithyia nods.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adalfuns, Imrys soothes, "There there."</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Imrys, Alosaka says, "Wouldn't let go of his little Commander doll."</b>
</p><p>Imrys laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.
</p><p>Lithyia whispers something to Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Lithyia smiles at Aliashyrah.
</p><p><b>Adalfuns snickers, "Commander doll."</b>
</p><p>Lord Grutak just arrived.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "Something wicked this way comes..."</b>
</p><p>Adalfuns coughs.
</p><p>Lithyia says, "Well well."
</p><p>Imrys hums a happy tune, skillfully expressing her friendly mood.
</p><p>Lithyia turns to face Grutak.
</p><p>Sorlu glances at Grutak.
</p><p>Grutak gazes with interest at his surroundings.
</p><p>Aliashyrah chuckles.
</p><p>Sorlu grins slowly.
</p><p><b>Lithyia exclaims, "You are here!"</b>
</p><p>Adalfuns flashes a quick grin at Sorlu.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "Speaking of a Commander."
</p><p>Lithyia beams happily at Grutak!
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adalfuns, Alosaka exclaims, "Quick, look excited!"</b>
</p><p>Lithyia hugs Grutak, who wraps her in a warm embrace.
</p><p><b>Opalina says, "I don't know if Commander dolls are a thing these days."</b>
</p><p>Imrys grins at Alosaka.
</p><p>Lithyia gives Grutak a lingering kiss on the cheek.
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles at Opalina.
</p><p>Adalfuns clears his throat.
</p><p>With straightened posture and a firm chin, Sorlu presents himself to Grutak with a short, courteous bow.

</p><p><b>Grutak asks, "Commander dolls?"</b>

</p><p><b>Speaking to Adalfuns, Imrys says, "Now you can hug the real thing."</b>
</p><p>Speaking to Grutak, Sorlu says, "Good evening, Commander."
</p><p><b>Grutak says, "I have a doll in my locker..."</b>

</p><p><b>Grutak says, "It freaks people out though."</b>
</p><p><b>Teaberry says, "Action figures."</b>
</p><p>Adalfuns snickers at Lithyia.
</p><p>Sorlu grins.
</p><p><b>Opalina says, "They were talking about you being a sexy doll."</b>
</p><p>The mirror images surrounding Imrys undulate and grow stronger.
</p><p>Grutak put a dragonfly etched vultite no-dachi in his threaded war harness.
</p><p>Lithyia says, "I have the real deal."
</p><p>Lithyia points at Grutak.
</p><p>Opalina nods.
</p><p>Lithyia joins Grutak's group.
</p><p><b>Opalina says, "You know the usual."</b>
</p><p>Grutak gives Lithyia a lingering kiss on the forehead.
</p><p>Grutak asks, "What'd I miss?"
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "I'm so glad you could be here afterall."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia beams happily at Grutak!
</p><p><b>Speaking to Opalina, Aliashyrah says, "It is good you have better control of your tongue today. That would have been an unfortunate comment to mumble incorrectly."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia laughs at Aliashyrah!
</p><p><b>Opalina says, "Oh I almost said Commando."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia begins chuckling at Opalina!
</p><p>Opalina says, "It was there."
</p><p>Lithyia mutters doooooooong.
</p><p>Lithyia glances at Opalina.
</p><p>Lithyia giggles to herself.
</p><p>Adalfuns stares off into space.
</p><p>Speaking amusedly to Opalina, Aliashyrah says, "Not the word I was alluding to."
</p><p>Sorlu grins slowly.
</p><p>Opalina says, "It was where I was though."
</p><p>Alosaka clears his throat.
</p><p><b>Adalfuns says, "I thought that was Roelon's thing."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles.
</p><p>Imrys coughs.
</p><p>Lithyia giggles.
</p><p>Imrys glances away.
</p><p>Lithyia leans softly against Grutak.
</p><p><b>Opalina says, "Well he's not here I had to fill in."</b>
</p><p>Adalfuns says, "Can't steal the man's schtick."
</p><p><b>Speaking to Opalina, Sorlu says, "I was expecting him. I believe he might have been called away at the last moment."</b>
</p><p>Opalina says, "Can't fight exotic."
</p><p><b>Grutak says, "I can take my pants off and put on a kilt."</b>
</p><p>Opalina fans herself.
</p><p><b>Grutak says, "But I dont' think that'll have the same affect."</b>
</p><p>Opalina says, "Well talk like that and I might just die."
</p><p>Sorlu gazes in amusement at Grutak.

<p><b>Sorlu says, "On that note, perhaps we should begin..."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia says, "I mean..i wont complain."
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles to himself.
</p><p>Adalfuns starts chuckling at Sorlu!
</p><p>Lithyia gazes fondly at Grutak.

</p><p>Lithyia wiggles her eyebrows at Grutak.
</p><p>Imrys bites her lip.
</p><p>Speaking to Lithyia, Grutak says, "You see me commando anyway."
</p><p>Adalfuns waves to Randsford.
</p><p>Lithyia says, "Every night."
</p><p><b>Speaking to Sorlu, Opalina exclaims, "I thought it already begun!"</b>
</p><p>Randsford nods to Adalfuns in greeting.
</p><p>Lithyia wiggles her eyebrows.

</p><p>Adalfuns surreptitiously glances at Grutak.
</p><p>Adalfuns covers his ears.
</p><p>Sorlu grins at Opalina.
</p><p>Lithyia laughs!
</p><p>Aliashyrah selects an available padded seat and makes her way over to it, quietly taking a spot.
</p><p>Lithyia says, "What? he sleeps in the nude."
</p><p>Lithyia shrugs.
</p><p>Speaking to Sorlu, Opalina says, "Your late."
</p><p>Aliashyrah turns an inquisitive ear towards Sorlu.
</p><p>Alosaka folds his hands.
</p><p>(Grutak does some hip thrusts in Adalfuns general direction.)

</p><p>Lithyia coyly says, "Stop."
</p><p>Lithyia glances at Grutak.
</p><p>Lithyia giggles.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles charmingly.
</p><p>Imrys laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.
</p><p>Speaking to Sorlu, Grutak says, "I am not related to Lithyia."
</p><p>Adalfuns confusedly says, "Hello.. again."
</p><p>Adalfuns grins at Sorlu weakly.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "As we close out the glorious month of Ivastaen, already moving swiftly into the midst of the year, I thought it important that we might take a moment to pause in reflection of how far we, together, have come."</b>
</p><p>Grutak says, "Just to clareify."
</p><p>Lithyia laughs!

</p><p>Lithyia turns an inquisitive ear toward Sorlu.
</p><p><b>Sorlu sadly laments, "At that time, Icemule was not what she is today. She was wounded.. and without a leader. Still strong in heart, but aimless and threatened with the darkness of despair..."</b>

</p><p>Grutak removes a bleached skull jug with a sinew-hinged leather lid from in his onyx oilcloth greatcloak.
</p><p>Lithyia just opened a fluidly draped raw silk robe gathered at one shoulder by an ornate silver fibula.

</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "This is no coincidence."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu glances appraisingly around the room.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in agreement at Sorlu.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "As I look around, I see nothing but heroes. Heroes that have faced Zeban without flinching. Heroes that stood steadfast against a flying mechanical manticore even as it tore initially through our ranks. Heroes that stood against the full might of the Vaalorian city-state and delivered to it their Great Humiliation..."</b>
</p><p><b>Sorlu jokes, "Heroes that, I have no doubt, could prevent the sun from rising in the east, if we so chose."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.
</p><p>Lithyia starts chuckling at Sorlu!
</p><p><b>Sorlu continues, "But each of us, in our own way, has also sacrificed much to be where we are today. Icemule herself has sacrificed much. From accounts I've heard, the darkness we've faced over the last few years has taken nearly half our population beyond the Ebon Gate. This sacrifice needs to not be forgot."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu nods slowly.
</p><p>Aliashyrah frowns.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "And while we acknowledge that sacrifices are unavoidable in pursuit of the greater good, and even more might be asked of us as we continue to face the approaching darkness,  let our hearts not dwell on that, but instead, let us give thanks for the blessings we have been granted thus far..."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia frowns.
</p><p>Lithyia nods to Sorlu.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "I, for one, have known such blessings. As it is only through the merciful grace of Ivas that I was able to endure, and repel, the constant assault of the Tablet of Life as it attempted to take root within me. Roots that withered before Her divine touch..."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia folds her hands.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "Her mercy has thus far extended over all of Icemule, in fact...as even now Her undead minions are held in place by the High Priestess Niatha. Blessed we are that they do not swarm down the mountain and overwhelm our town, but such is the mercy of Ivas, as has been shown to the Sisters of Hope as well."</b>
</p><p><b>Sorlu brushes his fingers lightly against his emerald talisman.</b>
</p><p>Sorlu smiles quietly to himself.
</p><p><b>Sorlu murmurs, "Praise be to Ivas..."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu casually glances around the room.

</p><p>Jadedragan turns to Lithyia and cheers!
</p><p>Lithyia grins at Jadedragan.
</p><p>Jadedragan says, "Evening all."
</p><p>Imrys gently brushes her pearl blonde hair away from her eyes and, with a deft twist of her wrist, tucks it back into its bindings.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "And as we close out the month of Ivastaen, and think back on all of these blessings, I have asked Aliashyrah to lead us all in a unified observation of appreciation and thanksgiving."</b>

</p><p><b>Aliashyrah says, "A lovely ending to Ivastean."</b>
</p><p>Roelon whispers something to Randsford.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods.
</p><p>Lithyia just opened a beaded bauble bag.
</p><p>Lithyia gazes at her reflection in the pendant mirror.
</p><p>Roelon reaches out and touches his ebony symbol of Ronan.
</p><p>Lithyia just closed a beaded bauble bag.
</p><p>Aliashyrah says, "I know many of you are anxious to return to the mists."
</p><p>Lithyia smiles at Grutak.
</p><p><b>Adalfuns admits, "I'm still processing what just happened."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah smiles at Adalfuns.
</p><p>Imrys gently brushes her pearl blonde hair away from her eyes and, with a deft twist of her wrist, tucks it back into its bindings.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "Thank you all for gathering tonight in this ceremony and we seek out the desired future. Together, in this purpose, we are unstoppable."</b>
</p><p>Randsford nods in agreement at Adalfuns.
</p><p>Sorlu puts a slender Nalfein-styled cane in his dark hematite overcoat.
</p><p>Alosaka nods understandingly.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adalfuns, Randsford says, "We still owe Eorgina."</b>
</p><p>(Lithyia holds her hand out to Grutak.)
</p><p>Aliashyrah picks up a pale green stylized wisp candle.
</p><p>Randsford gazes heavenward.
</p><p>Aliashyrah put a pale green stylized wisp candle in her obsidian satin robe.
</p><p>Adalfuns shifts his weight.
</p><p>Lithyia gazes fondly at Grutak.
</p><p>Sorlu picks up a pale green stylized wisp candle.
</p><p>Alosaka runs his fingertips along the silver script inlaid into his miniature sterling silver sickle's surface.  Faint traces of light well up from the tiny words in the wake of his touch.
</p><p>Sorlu puts a pale green stylized wisp candle in his dark hematite overcoat.
</p><p>Grutak glances at Lithyia.
</p><p><b>Adalfuns asks, "What's this we stuff?"</b>
</p><p>Sorlu snuffs out the stylized wisp candle.
</p><p>Imrys grins at Adalfuns.
</p><p>Sorlu picks up a pale green stylized wisp candle.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adalfuns, Randsford says, "Icemule."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu grins at Adalfuns.
</p><p><b>Roelon deeply says, "We owe her, or she will take is mah guess."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu agrees with Randsford.
</p><p>Lithyia frowns at Grutak.
</p><p>Roelon slowly empties his lungs.
</p><p>Alosaka smiles.
</p><p>Adalfuns grins sheepishly.
</p><p>Lithyia glances down.
</p><p>Aliashyrah snuffs out a pale green stylized wisp candle.
</p><p><b>Alosaka says, "Eorgina will collect what she is due, in her time."</b>
</p><p>Randsford nods in agreement at Alosaka.
</p><p>Imrys nods at Alosaka.
</p><p><b>Alosaka says, "The grave is endlessly patient."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Alosaka.
</p><p>Imrys stares at Adalfuns.
</p><p>Randsford chuckles.
</p><p>Roelon shifts his weight.
</p><p>Imrys prods Adalfuns's ribs gently with her elbow and he flinches.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Alosaka, Sorlu says, "A debt is still owed to her as well."</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah asks, "Was there not plans to build a statue of some sort to her?"</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah asks, "Or perhaps some temple?"</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah asks, "Or was that to another?"</b>
</p><p>Lithyia glances down.
</p><p><b>Imrys says, "I thought that's what I had heard as well."</b>
</p><p>Alosaka says, "They ought to replace that terrible statue of her outside the Landing graveyard. It's profane."
</p><p><b>Speaking to Aliashyrah, Sorlu says, "A statue, or altar to her was promised once...yes."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia frowns at Grutak.
</p><p>Imrys nods to Sorlu.
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah says, "I am not sure I would break a promise to her."</b>
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "I also think it foolish to risk the wrath of Eorgina by leaving a debt unpaid to her."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Aliashyrah.
</p><p><b>Lithyia glances down.</b>
</p><p>Randsford squints at Lithyia.
</p><p>Sorlu gazes with interest at Lithyia.
</p><p><b>(Lithyia tears well up in her eyes.)</b>
</p><p><b>Mistress Lithyia just went south.</b>
</p><p>Roelon furrows his brow.
</p><p>Roelon glances south.
</p><p>Sorlu glances south.
</p><p><b>Imrys stares at Grutak.</b>
</p><p>Randsford works his fingers under his banded knight's helm and scratches his head.
</p><p>Alosaka glances south.
</p><p><b>Imrys asks, "What did you do?"</b>
</p><p><b>Aliashyrah glares at Grutak.</b>
</p><p>Lady Aliashyrah just went south.
</p><p>Sorlu raises an eyebrow in Grutak's direction.
</p><p>Alosaka sighs.
</p><p>Adalfuns chuckles to himself.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Grutak, Alosaka says, "Possessiveness is not a virtue."</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Imrys, Grutak says, "I do not answer to you."</b>
</p><p>Speaking to Adalfuns, Imrys prompts, "Punch him."
</p><p>Imrys glances meaningfully at Grutak.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Alosaka, Grutak asks, "Who the hell said anything about possessiveness?"</b>
</p><p><b>The voice of Adene amusedly says, "Some simply cannot handle what was meant to be."</b>
</p><p>Alosaka shrugs.
</p><p><b>Adalfuns amusedly says, "This is more how I was expecting the night to go."</b>
</p><p>Roelon grins at Adalfuns.
</p><p>Randsford chuckles.
</p><p>Imrys closes her eyes for a moment.
</p><p>Jadedragan begins chuckling at Adalfuns!
</p><p>Sorlu grins at Adalfuns.
</p><p>Adene suddenly fades into view.
</p><p>Adene leans on her staff.
</p><p><b>Adalfuns says, "That was impressive.  Hypnotic, even."</b>
</p><p>Grutak says, "Enjoy your evening."
</p><p><b>Adene draws her hands together in a slow, deliberate clap.</b>
</p><p>Imrys agrees with Adalfuns.
</p><p>Lord Grutak just went south.
</p><p>Adene glances south.
</p><p>Alosaka shakes his head.
</p><p>Adalfuns nods in agreement to Sorlu.
</p><p>Imrys gazes heavenward.
</p><p>Adene chuckles to herself.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Adene.
</p><p><b>Alosaka says, "Character is fate."</b>
</p><p>Adene gives a sidelong glance at Sorlu.
</p><p>Adene grins slowly.
</p><p>Speaking to Adene, Sorlu says, "Hello, Adene."
</p><p>Jadedragan barks loudly!
</p><p>Speaking silkily to Sorlu, Adene greets, "Good evening, Rat King."
</p><p>Narrowing her gaze, Adene inclines her head in a greeting that is punctuated by the nonsensical whispering of lost souls.
</p><p>Jadedragan croaks out a bark of embarrassment.
</p><p>Alosaka leans back.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles.
</p><p>Randsford bows.
</p><p>Imrys nods at Adalfuns.
</p><p>Randsford says, "Good evening as well."
</p><p>Adene observes her surroundings with a keen eye.
</p><p>Also here: Lady Adene, Roelon, Jadedragan who is sitting, Lord Randsford, Adalfuns who is sitting, Imrys who is sitting, Squire Alosaka, Lord Sorlu
</p><p>Lord Randsford just went south.

<p><b>Imrys amusedly asks, "What is it with people storming out of here tonight?"</b>
</p><p>Sorlu grins at Imrys.
</p><p>Roelon slowly empties his lungs.
</p><p><b>Adene delightedly purrs, "Jealousy and ire."</b>
</p><p><b>Adalfuns says, "That's three."</b>
</p><p>Adene licks her lips.
</p><p>Adalfuns glances south.
</p><p>Imrys laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement from Adene.
</p><p>Roelon tugs on the voluminous tartan-lined hood of his black leather duster, allowing it to shadow his face.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Imrys, Sorlu says, "We don't do anything in Icemule unless it is fueled by emotion."</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Imrys, Alosaka says, "I think they knew I was going to start asking about virtues."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles.
</p><p>Adene flicks at the end of the pale green jade half-ring in her lip thoughtfully with her tongue.
</p><p><b>Speaking lightly to Adalfuns, Imrys says, "I knew we'd fit right in."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu grins.
</p><p><b>Adalfuns says, "Grutak's always mad, I didn't realize anything was wrong."</b>
</p><p><b>Alosaka says, "Well, Lord Sorlu, I can't say you don't put on great meetings up here."</b>
</p><p>Imrys laughs at Adalfuns!
</p><p>Sorlu laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.
</p><p>Jadedragan begins chuckling at Adalfuns!
</p><p>Adene chuckles.
</p><p>Sorlu squints at Alosaka.
</p><p>Lady Aliashyrah just arrived.
</p><p>Sorlu flashes a wide grin.
</p><p>Alosaka nods to Sorlu.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adalfuns, Jadedragan says, "It's a fair point. We need some range to gauge levels and all that."</b>
</p><p>Adene raises an eyebrow.
</p><p>Imrys whispers something to Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Adalfuns adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Sorlu, Alosaka exclaims, "Oh, I agree. This was... much more than I thought!"</b>
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "My only hope is that tonight inspired a sense of unity amongst those gathered."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah whispers something to Imrys.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles quietly to yourself.
</p><p>A pained expression crosses Imrys's face as she grimaces at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Alosaka sighs.
</p><p><b>Speaking silkily to Aliashyrah, Adene remarks, "A lovely ceremony, Priestess."</b>
</p><p>Adene inclines her head.
</p><p><b>Alosaka says, "Well, as to that, perhaps unity for some."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah whispers something to Imrys.
</p><p>Straightening her back, Aliashyrah gives a formal, low curtsy to Adene.  She inclines her head as well, giving Adene a brief nod.
</p><p>Alosaka shrugs.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adene, Aliashyrah says, "Were you in attendance? My apologies. My attention was rather focused."</b>
</p><p>Adene grins slowly.
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Alosaka.
</p><p>Alosaka nods appreciatively to Sorlu.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods in agreement at Imrys.
</p><p><b>Speaking gently to Aliashyrah, Adene assures, "Not a worry. I'm merely an observer, far be it from me to interfere."</b>
</p><p>Jadedragan stands up.
</p><p>Jadedragan dusts off his black cordovan apron.
</p><p>Alosaka shifts his weight.
</p><p>Jadedragan tightens the black cordovan of his black cordovan apron.  Sharply quirking one eyebrow, Jadedragan clenches his fists and pushes them together, flexing his biceps alternately in an artless display of brawn.
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Alosaka.
</p><p>Jadedragan whistles tunelessly to himself.
</p><p>Speaking to Adene, Aliashyrah says, "I do not believe I have seen you around. I am Aliashyrah Ilthaerhys."
</p><p><b>Speaking thoughtfully to Aliashyrah, Adene adds, "Though I might've offered blood to Our Lady and carved that dreadful Niima tattoo right from her wrist."</b>
</p><p>Alosaka wrings his hands.
</p><p>Adene chuckles to herself.
</p><p>Adene cocks her head at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Aliashyrah gazes in amusement at Adene.
</p><p>Adalfuns chuckles to himself.
</p><p>Imrys gazes in amusement at Adene.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adene, Aliashyrah purrs, "All in good time."</b>
</p><p>Speaking simply to Aliashyrah, Adene introduces, "Adene Andrenae. A pleasure."
</p><p>Sorlu glances between Aliashyrah and Adene.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adene, Aliashyrah says, "Though had I known there was another who so reveres Ivas, I might have invited you to join in."</b>
</p><p>Adene smiles.
</p><p>Adene raises an eyebrow.
</p><p>Alosaka turns to face Aliashyrah.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Aliashyrah, Adene says, "The Lady knows where I stand - no invitation necessary."</b>
</p><p>Adene cocks her head.
</p><p>Adene flicks at the end of the pale green jade half-ring in her lip thoughtfully with her tongue.
</p><p>Aliashyrah nods slightly.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Aliashyrah, Alosaka begins, "Lady Aliashyrah, as a devotee of Ivas, I wonder if I might ask you a question. For a project I am working on."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah looks thoughtfully at Alosaka.
</p><p><b>Adene adds, "Or I would not have been led here."</b>
</p><p>Adene chuckles.
</p><p>Adene observes her surroundings with a keen eye.
</p><p>Jadedragan just went south.
</p><p>Speaking to Adene, Aliashyrah agrees, "Indeed."
</p><p><b>Speaking to Alosaka, Aliashyrah asks, "What is your question?"</b>
</p><p>Alosaka nods appreciatively.
</p><p>Adene leans on her staff.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Aliashyrah, Alosaka asks, "If it pleases you, of all the virtues known or suspected to exist, which is most important to you?"</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah gazes with interest at Alosaka.
</p><p>Adene raises an eyebrow in Alosaka's direction.
</p><p>Imrys cocks her head.
</p><p>Alosaka opens his morduska hide book.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Alosaka, Aliashyrah asks, "That is an interesting question. Might I ask the purpose of your project?"</b>
</p><p>Alosaka flips through his morduska hide book.
</p><p>Sorlu grins.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Aliashyrah, Alosaka says, "I am asking the question of as many people as I can. You will be the ninety-ninth. Lord Sorlu here said that Persistence was his prime virtue."</b>
</p><p>Alosaka nods appreciatively to Sorlu.
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Alosaka.
</p><p>Aliashyrah smiles at Sorlu.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Sorlu, Aliashyrah says, "A good choice."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu grins.
</p><p><b>Alosaka says, "It is part of an effort for me to understand what drives people. I have been impressed with the range of answers so far."</b>
</p><p>Imrys tilts her head and tosses an inviting wink in Adalfuns's direction.
</p><p>Alosaka says, "And I am curious what the rest of you, minus Lord Sorlu, might think as well."
</p><p>Alosaka smiles.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Alosaka, Aliashyrah says, "I would say clarity of purpose would be the greatest virtue. For with it, all comes naturally. Both knowing who one is and what one desires can offer a freedom and guidance to life that is lacking for many."</b>
</p><p>Adalfuns snickers.
</p><p>Alosaka nods at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Sorlu grins.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adalfuns, Imrys whispers aloud, "Are you going to say chastity?"</b>
</p><p>Sorlu nods approvingly at Aliashyrah.
</p><p>Alosaka rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Sorlu smirks at Imrys.
</p><p>Sorlu snickers.
</p><p><b>Adalfuns sourly says, "Never."</b>
</p><p>Imrys laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.
</p><p>Speaking teasingly to Imrys, Aliashyrah says, "For your sake, I hope not."
</p><p>Imrys hums a happy tune, skillfully expressing her friendly mood.
</p><p>Adene chuckles.
</p><p>Sorlu grins at Aliashyrah.
</p><p><b>Adalfuns says, "I'm avoiding Alosaka and his book."</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Aliashyrah, Alosaka says, "That is very interesting... I admit, I half-expected you to say Passion, which might have been too simple of an expectation."</b>
</p><p>Alosaka ponders.
</p><p>Adene turns an inquisitive ear toward Alosaka.
</p><p>Aliashyrah begins chuckling at Alosaka!
</p><p>Adene flicks at the end of the pale green jade half-ring in her lip thoughtfully with her tongue.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Alosaka, Aliashyrah says, "Then perhaps you were not listening well enough during the ceremony."</b>
</p><p><b>Alosaka says, "I'm not even sure how to distill Clarity of Purpose into a virtue I know of... but it clearly has a concrete meaning and I understand it instantly."</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking smoothly to Alosaka, Aliashyrah says, "Be careful how limited you cast your view."</b>
</p><p>Alosaka nods understandingly at Aliashyrah.
</p><p><b>Alosaka dryly says, "I am duly chastised."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.
</p><p>(Adene idly drums her lengthy fingernails against her staff.)
</p><p>Imrys grins.
</p><p>Adene ponders.
</p><p>Alosaka nods slightly.
</p><p>Adalfuns grins wryly at Alosaka.
</p><p>Alosaka gives a sidelong glance at Adene.
</p><p>Adene raises an eyebrow in Alosaka's direction.
</p><p>Alosaka glances away.
</p><p>Imrys glances between Alosaka and Adene.
</p><p>Adene smiles sweetly.
</p><p>Adalfuns laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement.
</p><p>Imrys grins impishly.
</p><p><b>Speaking silkily to Alosaka, Adene asks, "Something on your mind, darling?"</b>
</p><p>Alosaka chuckles.
</p><p><b>Speaking amusedly to Adalfuns, Imrys says, "He's blushing."</b>
</p><p>Aliashyrah smirks.
</p><p>Adalfuns says, "I was blushing for him, Imrys."
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adene, Alosaka says, "Well, forgive me, I don't even know your name."</b>
</p><p>Adene chuckles.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adene, Alosaka says, "But I perceive you also follow Lady Ivas."</b>
</p><p>Speaking kindly to Alosaka, Adene introduces, "Adene Andrenae."
</p><p>Alosaka nods appreciatively.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Alosaka, Adene says, "I do. For many a long year now."</b>
</p><p>Adene raises an eyebrow.
</p><p>Adene flicks at the end of the pale green jade half-ring in her lip thoughtfully with her tongue.
</p><p>Speaking to Adene, Alosaka replies, "Alosaka."
</p><p>Adene inclines her head.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adene, Alosaka asks, "I don't suppose you would care to volunteer a virtue?"</b>
</p><p>Adene gazes in amusement at Alosaka.
</p><p>Adene bites her lip.
</p><p>Alosaka leans forward.
</p><p>Adene grins slowly.
</p><p>Sorlu raises an eyebrow in Adene's direction.
</p><p>Adene leans forward.
</p><p>Aliashyrah gazes with interest at Adene.
</p><p>Adalfuns turns an inquisitive ear toward Adene.
</p><p><b>Speaking thoughtfully to Alosaka, Adene offers, "Suppose that Ivas does not adhere to virtues."</b>
</p><p><b>Adene adds, "They are, after all, silly mortal concepts."</b>
</p><p>Adene examines her fingernails.
</p><p>Adene tilts her head up.
</p><p>Alosaka chuckles.
</p><p><b>Alosaka says, "I can suppose that... but if I may..."</b>
</p><p><b>Adene adds, "However.. She does strive for excellency, and advantage."</b>
</p><p>Adene raises an eyebrow.
</p><p>Alosaka nods.
</p><p><b>Speaking silkily to Alosaka, Adene coos, "You may."</b>
</p><p>Adene tilts her head toward Alosaka, examining him intently as the tip of one ear twitches briefly.
</p><p><b>Alosaka says, "Well, as you say, surely she expects certain things from her adherents. Some characteristics must set her most prized followers from the...dross."</b>
</p><p>Imrys gazes in amusement at Adalfuns.
</p><p><b>Adene amusedly says, "Certainly. But I would not call them... virtues. So much as goals to feed her power."</b>
</p><p>Adene chuckles.
</p><p>Adalfuns drawls, "You can safely put her down for none."
</p><p>Alosaka begins chuckling at Adalfuns!
</p><p>Imrys laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adene, Alosaka asks, "Don't mind the connotations inherent in 'virtue.' I simply mean, what characteristic do you wish more people exhibited?"</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking sagely to Alosaka, Adene says, "That is our true work. She thrives through action and emotion."</b>
</p><p>Adene cocks her head at Alosaka.
</p><p>Adene raises an eyebrow.
</p><p><b>Alosaka says, "That is all a virtue is, I think."</b>
</p><p>Adene amusedly says, "Quaint."
</p><p>Adene rubs her chin thoughtfully.
</p><p><b>Alosaka says, "I'm sure Zerroth must hold cruelty and brutality as virtues. I don't begrudge him that."</b>
</p><p><b>Imrys amusedly asks, "So they are subjective?"</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking smoothly to Alosaka, Adene explains, "I care nothing of what people chose to exhibit or not. Only that they lend their energy to Her. She will determine worthiness, and what is to be drawn from."</b>
</p><p>Alosaka nods at Imrys.
</p><p><b>Sorlu politely says, "If you will all excuse me, I must attend to some business."</b>
</p><p>Adene leans on her staff.
</p><p>Alosaka nods to Sorlu.
</p><p>Adalfuns nods appreciatively to Sorlu.
</p><p><b>Speaking amusedly to Sorlu, Adene asks, "Is that what you call it these days?"</b>
</p><p>Adene grins slowly.
</p><p>Alosaka rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Adene flicks at the end of the pale green jade half-ring in her lip thoughtfully with her tongue.
</p><p>Imrys smiles at Sorlu.
</p><p>Adalfuns says, "It's always entertaining."
</p><p><b>Speaking to Adene, Sorlu says, "A Councillor's work is never done."</b>
</p><p>Imrys inclines her head.
</p><p>Sorlu flashes a quick grin.
</p><p><b>Sorlu says, "Pleasant evening, all."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu offers a polite nod, touching two fingers against his forehead in a brief salute as he tucks his opposite hand into the bloodjewel-fastened pocket of his obsidian waistcoat.
