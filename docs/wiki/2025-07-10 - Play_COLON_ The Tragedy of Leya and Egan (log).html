<b>Bakarus serenely says, "Eternal light all."</b>

Bakarus smiles and makes his way toward the stage, glancing briefly at the attendants snuffing the house lights. By the time he reaches the center of it, the amphitheater is largely dark, drawing all attention to the brightly lit stage.

<b>Bakarus introduces, "I am Bakarus Klysus, a humble pilgrim who is fortunate to have the privilege of representing the Order this evening."</b>

<b>Bakarus appreciatively expresses, "But first, a very deserved thank you to Chatalaine Traiva and House Brigatta for making this possible. Sister Traiva, if you are in the room, thank you. You are the best of us."</b>

Bakarus coughs.

Bakarus suddenly loses his balance and stumbles a bit to the left before righting himself.

You smile at Traiva.

Bakarus coughs.

Traiva turns toward Bakarus and flutters her wings out wide for Bakarus to see.

Zeminar nods once.

Riend nods approvingly at Traiva.

Tikba smiles at Traiva.

<b>Bakarus apologizes, "Please excuse me. My constitution is not what it once was."</b>

Bakarus rubs his chin thoughtfully.

Missoni nods sympathetically.

<b>Bakarus wonders, "Now, where was I? Ahh, yes..."</b>

<b>Bakarus proclaims, "Tonight! I will be your narrator as we reenact that most tragic tale, the tale of Leya and Egan."</b>

Lylia leans forward and rests her chin in her hand, a thoughtful expression on her face.

Tikba gazes with interest at Bakarus.

<b>Bakarus excitedly introduces, "Our titular roles of Leya and Egan will be played by Madam Naamit and Master Peatwyn this evening. And of course, perhaps a special guest or two..."</b>

<b>Bakarus implores, "Please... let's give them a round of applause to help steel their nerves."</b>

Aerelean applauds.

Zeminar applauds.

Cryheart applauds.

You applaud.

Yunni applauds.

Arbeia applauds politely.

Riend applauds warmly.

You smile.

Keirloran applauds.

Missoni applauds warmly.

Lylia applauds.

Kothos applauds Bakarus.

Tikba applauds.

Kothos smiles.

<i>Bakarus lowers his hands slowly to quiet the room.</i>

Cryheart says, "Such a tragic tale it is."

Ordim applauds politely.

You rub your glass amulet.

You become invisible.
Cast Roundtime 3 Seconds.

Cryheart nods at Bakarus.

Jaired applauds.

Ryans applauds warmly.

Littlemelody applauds.

<b>Bakarus dramatically whispers aloud, "So... without further ado..."</b>

Lylia folds her hands in her lap.

Zeminar agrees with Cryheart.

Cryheart nods at Zeminar.

<i>Bakarus waves his hand toward the darkened stage behind him. He slowly moves to stage left as he talks.</i>

Speaking quietly to Cryheart, Jaired says, "No spoilers."

Cryheart clasps his hand over his mouth.

Cryheart mumbles something under his breath.

<b>Bakarus recites grandiosely:</b>

   <b> "Today... most only know Leya as the daughter of mighty Kai and the elf, Learya."</b>

Jaired starts chortling.

Arbeia turns an inquisitive ear toward Bakarus.

Riend gazes in amusement at Cryheart.

<b>Bakarus recites knowingly:</b>

   <b> "Fearsome in battle, she is often associated with wielding but a simple ivory-hilted dagger."</b>

<b>Bakarus recites trepidatiously:</b>

   <b> "Though... </b>
      
   <b>  There is one tale."</b>

Bakarus smiles.

Kothos takes a moment to observe Bakarus.

Jaired turns an inquisitive ear toward Bakarus.

<b>Bakarus recites ominously:</b>

   <b> "Where she wielded a different blade..."</b>

Arelder leans forward.

Arelder gazes with interest at Bakarus.

Cryheart nods at Bakarus.

Bakarus pulls his black ora longsword out of its troll-arm sheath accompanied by a wet squishy sound.

<b>Speaking longingly to his black ora longsword, Bakarus whispers aloud, "A certain sword by the name of Soulingen..."</b>

<i>Bakarus's voice goes hoarse as he gazes at the blade as if transfixed.</i>

Bakarus blinks.

<i>Bakarus glances up as if only noticing the audience again and grins.</i>

Arbeia takes a moment to observe Bakarus.

<b>Bakarus recites playfully:</b>

    <b>"This, dear friends, is where our story truly begins..."</b>

<i>Bakarus steps to the left side of the stage in a halo of candlelight, revealing the work of the stagehands assembling scenery in the background.</i>

Arbeia nods at Bakarus.

Luxelle inclines her ear, listening intently.

<b>Bakarus whimsically narrates, "As Leya often did, she was wandering through the forest to a pool she knew well where she could enjoy quiet contemplation."</b>

Naamit comes out of hiding.

<i>Naamit strides from behind a painted scrim at stage right.  Reaching a tussock of grass near center stage, she stops and stares at something near it.</i>

Bakarus glances at Naamit.

Jaired leans forward.

Lylia turns to face Naamit.

<b>Bakarus narrates, "However, this day would be different. Lying next to the pool was an elf."</b>

Kothos gazes with interest at Naamit.

Tikba takes a drink from her honeysuckle liramea.
  CS: +300 - TD: +300 + CvA: +15 + d100: +27 == +42
  Warded off!

Peatwyn suddenly fades into view.

<i>Peatwyn stirs and groans as if in pain.</i>

Arbeia takes a moment to observe Peatwyn.

Peatwyn sits down.

Kothos gazes in awe at Peatwyn.

<i>Peatwyn struggles to stand, but can only manage to pull himself to a seated position. The effort seems to have taken all his energy.</i>

Tikba glances between Naamit and Peatwyn.

Peatwyn hangs his head.

<b>Bakarus earnestly narrates, "Leya almost turned to leave, but catching a glimpse of his face... his beauty drew her to him."</b>

<i>Naamit takes a few cautious steps toward the slumped figure, her hand outstretched toward him.</i>

<i>Peatwyn struggles to stay conscious, his breathing ragged from his wounds.</i>

<i>Naamit hesitates a moment longer before biting her lip in consternation.  She rushes to the elf's side and assesses his wounds.</i>

Yunni leans forward.

Peatwyn moans.

Riend bites her lip.

Naamit frets.

<i>Naamit rips a strip of hem from her linen tunic and tries to staunch the blood, tending his injuries as best she can.</i>

<b>Naamit desperately laments, "Oh, the blood, so much blood...  I cannot bear this!  Spirits, hear me!"</b>

<i>Naamit beseeches the spirits of the forest for aid in a keening, haunting cry.</i>

<i>Peatwyn slowly opens his eyes as the pain begins to subside.</i>

Zeminar turns an inquisitive ear toward Naamit.

<i>Peatwyn smiles weakly at Naamit.</i>

Arbeia leans forward.

<i>Naamit helps Peatwyn slowly to his feet.  He steadies himself on her shoulder, and they move at a halting pace toward stage right.</i>

<b>Bakarus narrates, "The two departed on the short journey to Leya's woodland home where Egan might continue his recovery."</b>

<i>Bakarus raises his voice slightly to disguise the muffled footsteps of stagehands changing out scenery behind him.</i>

Peatwyn stands up.

<b>Bakarus continues, "By the time the couple reached her home, Egan was nearly healed, although still weakened from his ordeal. Without Gosaena's sickle above him, he was now able to see Leya clearly."</b>

Yunni leans forward.

<b>Bakarus quietly adds, "And he was enchanted."</b>

Peatwyn glances appreciatively at Naamit.

Missoni smiles.

<b>Peatwyn charmingly says, "I have forgotten my manners. Forgive me for not introducing myself to my savior sooner.  My name is Egan of House Vaalor."</b>

Peatwyn smiles and offers a courteous bow, wincing slightly at his healing wounds.

<b>Peatwyn explains, "As I was attempting to enter an old sorcerer's tower, I was discovered. Deathly spells were cast at me, causing me to fall from the battlements."</b>

Peatwyn whispers aloud, "The next thing I remember... is waking up near the lake with you taking care of me."<b></b>

Peatwyn gazes fondly at Naamit.

Naamit nods understandingly.

<i>Naamit covers his hand with hers, and the two freeze in tableau as Bakarus picks up the thread of the story.</i>

Arelder takes a moment to observe Peatwyn.

<b>Bakarus narrates, "What Egan did not know was that the sorcerer had taken pity upon him and teleported him to the lake, knowing that Leya would find him."</b>

<b>Bakarus continues, "As the two grew to know each other over the passing days and Egan regained his strength, a deeper fondness set in."</b>

<b>Bakarus earnestly narrates, "Each stealing glances at the other, spending afternoons in animated conversation, this warmth soon blossomed into love."</b>

Arbeia smiles.

<b>Bakarus regretfully narrates, "However much Egan loved spending these weeks with Leya, he knew it would soon be time to return home."</b>

<b>Peatwyn hopefully says, "Leya, my... my love." He takes Naamit's hand in his and holds it to his chest. "I must return home to assure my family that I am well."</b>

<b>Peatwyn begs, "Please... come with me."</b>

Naamit shakes her head and turns away.

<b>Naamit recites sadly:</b>

   <b> "No...  I cannot go with you.  I am forbidden to leave the forest by my father."</b>

<b>Naamit promises, "Instead, let us meet again in one moon's time.  I can speak to him, and we may do this the right way."</b>

<i>Naamit's expression softens as she gazes at Peatwyn.</i>

<b>Naamit says, "It must be enough, for now.  Until then, I shall see you in my dreams, and there I shall be united with the one I love."</b>

<i>Naamit and Peatwyn embrace as the stage behind Bakarus goes dark with a sudden rush of activity from unseen stagehands.</i>

Lylia leans forward.

Naamit rubs her glass amulet.
Naamit suddenly disappears.

Arbeia smiles.

<b>Bakarus narrates, "Egan returned home with his heart full of joy. He would see his friends and family again and reunite with his newfound love soon."</b>

<b>Bakarus concernedly narrates, "Yet as Egan drew closer to home, he noticed houses shuttered against the night instead of blazing with candlelight. All was quiet, unnervingly so..."</b>

You are visible again.

<b>Bakarus continues, "Though happy to be home, Egan sensed something was amiss with his family, especially as his father met him in the courtyard beneath a still and silent sky."</b>

You turn to face Peatwyn.

Ibar rubs his chin thoughtfully.

<i>Aenternoll goes to embrace his son, clapping him on the back before holding him by the shoulders to get a good look at him in the wan light of a gibbous Liabo.</i>

Riend rubs her hands together anxiously, working her thumb distractedly over her elegant fingers.

Zeminar shifts his eyes to you.

Luxelle gulps.

<b>Peatwyn concernedly asks, "Father, speak truly... everyone I have passed seems anxious and worried, if they even venture out of their homes at all to speak.  What is wearing on them?"</b>

Jaired wrings his hands.

<b>You recite fearfully:</b>

   <b> "We have learned that an army of undead is amassing nearby for an attack on our town."</b>

Arbeia frowns.

<i>Aenternoll drops one hand from Peatwyn's shoulder and squeezes his forearm firmly.</i>

<b>You imploringly continue, "Now... I know you have just returned, and I see from your bearing that you have been hurt, but please stay and fight."</b>

<b>Peatwyn says, "The one who healed me needs me too. I made a promise that I would return to her when Liabo grows again."</b>

<b>You argue, "I know you are not quite seasoned in combat, and I can see how new love draws you elsewhere, but your sword will be welcomed."</b>

<b>You emphatically stress, "We will need all the warriors we can muster if we are to have a chance."</b>

Peatwyn frets.

Peatwyn clenches his jaw.

Peatwyn takes a deep breath.

<b>Peatwyn considers, "I..."</b>

Peatwyn nods slowly.

<i>Peatwyn turns to face Aenternoll.</i>

Kothos gazes with interest at Peatwyn.

<b>Peatwyn confidently confirms, "I will do as you ask of me, Father."</b>

You smile.

<b>Peatwyn resolutely continues, "I will help defend our town. We will repel the undead, protect those that we love, and bring honor to our family."</b>

<b>Peatwyn confidently assures, "And when this is over and done, I shall return to my love, meeting in the forest as promised... She will see her love covered in glory."</b>

Arelder ponders.

Rahj sighs.

<b>Bakarus recites, "And... scene!"</b>

<i>Bakarus brings his hand down in a sweeping gesture as the lights dim before the beginning of the second act.</i>

Kothos smiles.

You rub your glass amulet.
  1d100: 40 + Modifiers: 154 == 194

You become invisible.
Cast Roundtime 3 Seconds.

Jaired slowly empties his lungs.

Peatwyn rubs his glass amulet.

Peatwyn suddenly disappears.

Missoni bites her lip.

Luxelle says, "Oh, my."

Lylia bites her lip.

<b>Bakarus says, "Let us pause one moment for a very small intermission...a minute or two."</b>

Luxelle shifts her weight.

<b>Bakarus says, "I hope everyone enjoyed Act One."</b>

Bakarus smiles.

Cryheart nods at Bakarus.

Rahj exclaims, "This has been most entertaining so far!"

Jaired nods at Bakarus.

Ibar smiles.

Missoni nods appreciatively at Bakarus.

Keirloran nods in agreement.

Lylia nods enthusiastically!

You notice Zeminar slip into a hiding place.

Littlemelody says, "It's something I could watch many times."

Kothos grins.

<i>Bakarus gives a stagehand a nudge toward a mislaid prop and turns back to the audience.</i>

Cryheart smiles.

Bakarus shifts his weight.

Kothos begins chuckling at Bakarus!

<i>Bakarus clears his throat, drawing attention back to the stage.</i>

Arbeia turns to face Bakarus.

Arelder turns to face Bakarus.

<b>Bakarus muses, "Where did we leave off? Ahh, yes..."</b>

Peatwyn suddenly fades into view.

Peatwyn removes a bone-hilted vaalorn longsword from in his scarlet leather scabbard.

Cryheart walks over to the bench and settles down.

<b>Bakarus recites:</b>

    <b>"So, as he had promised, Egan marched to war."</b>

Arelder turns to face Bakarus.

Traiva gazes at Bakarus.

Jaired turns an inquisitive ear toward Bakarus.

<i>Peatwyn marches around the stage dramatically. He feints at invisible foes as offstage, zombie moans arise from the stagehands.</i>

Luxelle turns an inquisitive ear toward Bakarus.

Missoni nods grimly.

Tikba takes a moment to observe Peatwyn.

<b>Bakarus continues, "Still green but full of optimism, he dreamed of great victories in battle as bold young lovers often do."</b>

Riend tilts her head toward Bakarus, examining him intently as the tip of one ear twitches briefly.

<b>Bakarus expounds, "As the first stages of battle unfolded, there were a handful of light skirmishes which further boosted young Egan's confidence."</b>

<i>Peatwyn swings his blade about in wild flourishes. A dark moon rises and then sets over the imagined battlefield as the undead groans grow quieter. Candles behind the painted forest scrim mimic the coming dawn.</i>

Ibar smiles.

<b>Bakarus recites:</b>

    <b>"Egan would begin that fateful day,</b>
     <b>With a pitched battle imminent,</b>
     <b>Reciting his morning prayers."</b>

<b>Bakarus softly continues, "Yet his thoughts wandered to Leya."</b>

Arelder ponders.

Peatwyn kneels down and begins to recite prayers.

Bakarus gives a sidelong glance at Peatwyn.

<b>Peatwyn murmurs, "Leya, my love. We will end this today, and I will return to your side."</b>

<b>Peatwyn confidently says, "I know I am in your thoughts as you are in mine, and this gives me courage and lends me strength."</b>

<b>Peatwyn passionately vows, "We will reunite soon."</b>

Peatwyn stands up.

Peatwyn tightens his grip on his vaalorn longsword.

<i>Peatwyn makes his way offstage, determination written in every line of his furrowed brow.</i>

Peatwyn rubs his glass amulet.

Peatwyn suddenly disappears.

Bakarus smirks.

<b>Bakarus sighs, "Ah... love."</b>

Yunni gazes heavenward.

<b>Bakarus briskly narrates, "Meanwhile, in the forest where they first met..."</b>

Cryheart places a hand over his heart.

Naamit suddenly fades into view.

Arbeia turns an inquisitive ear toward Bakarus.

<i>Bakarus gives a small nod and the candles behind the scrim go dark, revealing the enchanted forest once again.</i>

Bakarus glances at Naamit.

Lylia glances at a lushly painted forest backdrop in deep perspective accented with a lone pale grey night heron feather in the foreground.

<b>Bakarus narrates, "The day of the rendezvous came and went. Leya waited nervously at the predetermined spot, waiting for any sign of Egan..."</b>

Naamit glances nervously around the room.

<i>Naamit twists the hem of her garment between anxious fingers, her gaze focused in the distance.</i>

<b>Bakarus anxiously continues, "Day passed and night came, and passed again in its turn. Leya made herself as comfortable as she could beside the pool and drifted off to restless dreams."</b>

Naamit lies down.

Naamit closes her eyes for a moment.

<b>Bakarus hisses, "The next morning as the sun rose, Leya woke with a start!"</b>

Naamit snaps her fingers.

<b>Bakarus fearfully narrates, "Leya had a bit of her mother's gift of foresight, and panic gripped her. She sensed even in her sleep that Egan was in terrible danger!"</b>

Naamit's eyes widen as she trembles in quiet panic.

Naamit moves to a kneeling position.

<i>Naamit makes her way on hands and knees to the pool, where she had first found the wounded elf.  She stares into the still waters, eyes widening in performative fear.</i>

<b>Naamit horrifiedly chokes out, "I see... the fires, the camp!  All destroyed.  Where is...  Oh, my beloved   NO!"</b>

Ryans inclines his ear, listening intently.

Naamit snarls menacingly!

<i>Naamit puts a hand to the hilt of her blade.</i>

<b>Bakarus ominously narrates, "The vision was crystal clear and very real."</b>

Arbeia frowns.

<b>Bakarus recites:</b>

    <b>"Egan was surrounded by his Elven companions,</b>
     <b>But they were vastly outnumbered by the army of the dead,</b>
    <b> Which was slowly encircling them."</b>

Ibar winces.

<b>Bakarus continues, "They came in unending waves that were soon going to overwhelm the brave Elven warriors, never tiring, never yielding..."</b>

Luxelle frets.

Kothos slowly empties his lungs.

Naamit stands up.

<i>Naamit strides away from the pond, her hands knotted into fists and her expression contorting into lethal fury.</i>

Cryheart fidgets.

<b>Naamit calls, "Rigaetha, to me!"</b>

<i>Naamit gives a shrill whistle to summon her mount and strides to the front of the stage in a galloping motion.</i>

Cryheart mutters undead.

<b>Bakarus exclaims, "In a fit of blinding rage, Leya urged her steed Rigaetha to a gallop, steering him toward the barrier of the forest!"</b>

Ibar shakes his head, clucking his tongue.

Arelder nods once at Cryheart.

<b>Bakarus urgently continues, "The pain of crossing through the magical field caused her to cry out in agony, but nothing was going to stop her."</b>

Naamit roars!

Bakarus rubs his chin thoughtfully.

<b>Bakarus narrates, "Now, Kai had felt and heard all this and rushed towards the forest, but he knew he would be too late."</b>

<b>Bakarus sorrowfully continues, "Leya had already broken through the barrier and he was too far away, fully engaged with the war against Despana."</b>

<b>Bakarus recites:</b>

    <b>"Leya had now arrived in her beloved's ancestral lands,</b>
    <b> Descending upon the battle like a tempest,</b>
     <b>Filled equally with fear for her beloved,</b>
    <b> And with hatred for the shambling evil that threatened him."</b>

Naamit deftly removes the black ora longsword from her swordbelt.

The shadows darken and lengthen from Naamit's black ora longsword and wrap around her hand.

As Naamit raises her black ora longsword, the shadows swirl upward and race off of it and ascend high above, darkening the room.  After a moment, they recede and return to the longsword, which flickers with pulses of greenish-black essence.

<b>Bakarus narrates, "Without a thought of caution, she unsheathed Soulingen with a blood lust so strong that it awakened the mighty weapon."</b>

Naamit looses a ghastly, keening wail!

<i>Naamit strides forth, the sound of her ululation amplifying with the curve of the amphitheater like bats seeking escape from a sudden mortal terror.</i>

<b>Bakarus exclaims, "The fury consumed her!"</b>

As Naamit waves the black ora longsword around, shadows swirl from it, momentarily obscuring Naamit from view.  A sibilant hiss is heard from within the gloom.

Tikba gazes with interest at Naamit.

<b>Bakarus recites:</b>

    <b>"With the daughter of Kai on their side,</b>
     <b>The Elves turned the tide and won the day!"</b>

You are visible again.

Peatwyn suddenly fades into view.

Peatwyn lets out a cheer!

You let out a cheer!

Cryheart lets out a cheer!

<b>Speaking in Elven, you exclaim, "For the pride of the Vaalor!"</b>

Jaired slowly empties his lungs.

Bakarus glances around the room.

<i>Aenternoll moves off stage, celebrating the victory with elven comrades.</i>

<b>Bakarus whispers aloud, "But unbeknownst to Leya, Luukos, Lord of Death and Lies, has also arrived on the battlefield that day."</b>

Arelder takes a moment to observe Bakarus.

Zeminar comes out of hiding.

<i>Bakarus turns toward the far side of the stage where the candles are winking out, one by one, as a dark figure passes before them.</i>

Luxelle shudders.

<i>Zeminar moves slowly onto the stage, barely distinguishable from the shadows behind him.</i>

Lylia shifts her eyes to Zeminar.

Jaired leans forward.

Grhim smiles ever so slightly.

Ordim scowls.

Bakarus glances at Zeminar.

Bakarus smiles with sinister intent, the expression half-hidden in the gloom.

Yunni frowns.

<b>Bakarus narrates, "Luukos hid in the shadows, watching and laughing, seeing to it that Egan was disguised in Leya's eyes to appear as one of the enemy."</b>

Zeminar cackles deep in his throat, his voice rising in chilling laughter.

Ibar gazes heavenward.

<b>Bakarus recites excitedly:</b>

    <b>"And as such...</b>
    <b> In her blindness,</b>
     <b>Leya slew Egan!"</b>

Cryheart winces.

Luxelle gasps.

Obviously overcome, Riend gives a quiet gasp.

Ibar nods slowly.

Yunni winces.

Kothos looks thoughtfully at Bakarus.

Naamit turns to face Peatwyn.

Arbeia sighs.

Naamit growls at Peatwyn.

Riend clasps her hand over her mouth.

Jaired coughs.

Peatwyn raises his hands toward Naamit in surrender!

Naamit reverses her grip on her black ora longsword and darts toward Peatwyn at an angle!
[SMR result: 203 (Open d100: 35)]
Sidling in close, she drags the blade across the back of Peatwyn's left arm!
   ... 20 points of damage!
   Powerful slash just cracks Peatwyn's shield arm!
   He is stunned!
Peatwyn starts to favor his wounded left arm!

Naamit rotates her wrist, her black ora longsword executing a casual spin as she advances upon Peatwyn!
[SMR result: 183 (Open d100: -3, Bonus: 40)]
Naamit's flashing blade, hypnotic in its fluidity, slices toward Peatwyn at the apex of its deadly arc!
  AS: +529 vs DS: -6 with AvD: +41 + d100 roll: +69 = +645
   ... and hits for 282 points of damage!
   Blast to Peatwyn's head destroys left eye!
   Brain obliterated!
   Disgusting, but painful only for a second.

<b> * Peatwyn drops dead at your feet!</b>


A small human child cries out, "Murder!".  His mother then sends him off for the night watchman.

The mesmerizing sway of body and blade glides to its inevitable end with one final twirl of Naamit's black ora longsword.

Someone screams, "Murder by Naamit!  Call the night watchman!"

<b> * Peatwyn just bit the dust!</b>

Arbeia glances at Peatwyn.

Arbeia shakes her head.

<b>Bakarus narrates, "As Egan fell, the disguise Luukos had placed on him fell away, revealing to Leya what she had done."</b>

Missoni fidgets.

Kothos stares at Peatwyn's lifeless body, apparently lost in thought.

<i>Zeminar watches with apparent satisfaction before melting into the shadows once more.</i>

Luxelle holds her breath.

Speaking naively to Arbeia, Arelder whispers aloud, "Good effects..."

Suddenly you have the strangest feeling that you are being watched.

The feeling fades as quickly as it came.

Tikba nods slowly.

Arbeia agrees with Arelder.

Zeminar rubs his putrid ether, causing shadows to coalesce and enshroud him completely.

Arbeia grins at Arelder.

The night watchman, leading a group of deputies, strides swiftly in.

With great ease, the night watchman grabs Naamit and shackles her wrists.

"Aha, Varlet!  I have you!" the night watchman cries out.
The night watchman then drags her off.

Arbeia rubs Arelder tenderly.

Arbeia smiles.

Cryheart blinks.

Ordim waves.

Greatorex blinks.

Tikba glances out.

<b>Bakarus says, "Perhaps one moment."</b>

Bakarus grins wryly.

Greatorex forces Peatwyn's mouth open, and pours in a small amount from his azurite flask.
A luminescent web briefly forms around Peatwyn, then fades into the body.

You are visible again.

You glance at Bakarus.

Arbeia chuckles to herself.

Suddenly you have the strangest feeling that you are being watched.

The feeling fades as quickly as it came.

You glance at Peatwyn.

Speaking to himself, Ordim whispers aloud, "That must be the special guest."

You shrug.

Ordim fidgets.

<b>You say, "That hasn't happened before...."</b>

Speaking surreptitiously to Lylia, Tikba says, "Your doorman is not very effective."

Kothos begins chuckling at Ordim!

Arbeia nods at Ordim.

Arelder frowns.

<b>You ask, "Who wrote this?"</b>

You glance around the room.

<b>Speaking to you, Bakarus says, "Terrible."</b>

You rub Peatwyn.

Lylia quietly notes, "He is not usually going to bar the night watchman."

Arelder stands up.

Arelder takes a moment to observe Peatwyn.

Kothos nods at Lylia.

Arbeia glances at Peatwyn.

Arbeia frowns.

Arelder glances at Arbeia.

Arbeia shrugs at Arelder.

Arelder turns to face Peatwyn.

Speaking to Lylia, Kothos says, "After all, we did nearly burn down the banyan..."

<b>You say, "I am sure our Leya will return shortly."</b>

Kothos glances at a tall wooden double-doored portal.

You smile.

Arelder sits down next to Arbeia.

Jaired nods to you.

Greatorex says, "Was that part of the play."

Arbeia smiles at Arelder.

You glance at a tall wooden double-doored portal.

Arelder frowns.

Luxelle touches one finger to her lips.

Riend slowly empties her lungs.

Arbeia rubs Arelder tenderly.

<b>Bakarus says, "There was much grieving for Egan."</b>

Arbeia nods.

<b>Bakarus says, "I think."</b>

Arbeia agrees with Bakarus.

Bakarus ponders.

You nod at Bakarus.

Luxelle nods at Bakarus.

Tikba nods understandingly at Bakarus.

Kothos says, "It extends over the course of a few minutes..."

Arelder glances between Bakarus and Peatwyn.

<b>Speaking to Bakarus, you ask, "Did we hire an understudy?"</b>

Arbeia starts chuckling at you!

Speaking quietly to Lylia, Kothos says, "Long enough for a certain Kindred's trial..."

Missoni murmurs, "One would think the law would appreciate good theatre."

<b>Speaking to you, Bakarus says, "Was not in the budget."</b>

Missoni shakes her head, clucking her tongue.

Arbeia snickers at Bakarus.

Jaired nods at Missoni.

<b>Speaking to you, Bakarus says, "We are poor, humble people."</b>

Kothos laughs softly, trying to hide his amusement from Missoni.

Riend agrees with Missoni.

<b>Speaking to Lylia, you ask, "You know the lines correct?"</b>

Arbeia gazes heavenward.

Ibar grins.

You glance at Lylia.

Ibar chuckles.

Arbeia turns to face Arelder.

Lylia blinks.

Arbeia rolls her eyes.

Arbeia leans softly against Arelder.

<i>Bakarus watches the scene with a look of deep sorrow on his face. His hands are folded before him.</i>

Speaking to Missoni, Kothos says, "A regretably humorless institution."

Grhim says, "This town has never appreciated the dramatic."

Ibar grins at Missoni.

Tikba appears to be struggling to keep a straight face as she glances at Bakarus.

<b>Bakarus recites:</b>

    <b>"Because of the power it contains,</b>
    <b> Egan's soul was now a part of Soulingen."</b>

Speaking to Grhim, Traiva agrees, "Not at all."

You nod at Bakarus.

Lylia says, "I do, but I am not exactly prepared..."

<b>Bakarus sadly resolves, "There would be no hope of resurrection."</b>

Bakarus appears lost in thought.

Madam Naamit strides in through a tall wooden double-doored portal with fluid grace, each footstep leaving behind a faintly glowing, murky sanguine eagle feather that twirls in her wake.

Naamit clears her throat.

Luxelle hangs her head.

Bakarus's black ora prayerbeads pulses and he looks a bit more vitalized.

You let out a cheer!

Ordim applauds politely.

Bakarus applauds.

Bakarus turns to Naamit and cheers!

Grhim applauds Naamit.

<b>You say, "Our Leya has returned to us."</b>

Riend gives a sidelong glance at Jaired.

Yunni leans softly against Ibar.

Naamit fans herself.

Kothos says, "Grief has kept her silent, clearly."

Traiva praises Naamit.

Ibar grins at Yunni.

Naamit clears her throat.

Cryheart whistles tunelessly to himself.

Lylia gives a sigh of relief.

Arelder frowns.

Kothos gazes with awe at Naamit.

You nod at Naamit.

Yunni grins at Naamit.

<b>You say, "We'll take it from the top."</b>

Ibar shakes his head, clucking his tongue.

You nod at Naamit.

Naamit begins chuckling at Aerelean!

Arelder gazes blankly at you.

Naamit falls to her knees beside the body of Peatwyn and wails mournfully!

Naamit cries in pain, her face contorted in torment as she weeps.

You rub your glass amulet.
Feels smooth!

You become invisible.
Cast Roundtime 3 Seconds.

<i>Bakarus watches the scene with a look of deep sorrow on his face. His hands are folded before him.</i>

Riend furrows her brow.

<i>Naamit collapses next to Peatwyn, cradling his lifeless body.</i>

<b>Bakarus recites:</b>

    <b>"Because of the power it contains,</b>
     <b>Egan's soul was now a part of Soulingen."</b>

Tikba gazes admiringly at Naamit.

<b>Bakarus sadly resolves, "There would be no hope of resurrection."</b>

Bakarus appears lost in thought.

<b>Bakarus thoughtfully continues, "Leya stayed next to Egan for some time, keeping vigil."</b>

Naamit dabs at the outer corners of her eyes, then looks off into the distance.

Naamit stands up.

Naamit nods once.

<b>Naamit somberly vows, "I will bring you to the place where we first met, my love."</b>

<b>Bakarus recites:</b>

    <b>"Legends say that it was at the bluff,</b>
    <b> By the pool where they first met,</b>
     <b>That Leya built Egan's tomb."</b>

Ibar smiles.

Peatwyn's body jerks and trembles involuntarily, his muscles no longer controlled by his brain.

<i>Bakarus moves toward the tussock of grass that first concealed Peatwyn's body, passing it on his way to the other side of the stage. His gaze directs the audience's attention to Naamit at center stage, softly haloed in light.</i>

Jaired sniffs.

Riend gets a blank look on her face.

<b>Bakarus stoically continues, "When Leya was done, atop a crown of boulders in what had once been a magical forest created by her father, she sealed Egan's tomb and whispered a final goodbye."</b>

<i>Naamit stacks some stones with apparent effort, completing the top of a cairn. She gazes over the tomb for a few moments.</i>

<b>Naamit forlornly whispers aloud, "Goodbye my love..."</b>

Naamit stares at her black ora longsword.

<b>Naamit angrily commands, "And you!  May you never tempt others with your seductive bloodlust again!"</b>

Cryheart sniffs.

Kothos gazes with interest at Naamit.

Luxelle sighs.

<i>Naamit casts Soulingen aside in anger.</i>

<b>Naamit exaggeratedly swears, "I shall never hold aught but a simple dagger for the rest of my days!"</b>

Arbeia sighs.

Bakarus nods knowingly.

The shadows surrounding Naamit's black ora longsword wrap tighter around her hand.

<b>Bakarus narrates, "Unbeknownst to her, that utterance acted as an incantation and forever bound the discarded blade upon the black marble surface, where it may still be seen today."</b>

Bakarus stares at Naamit.

Bakarus smiles sadly.

<b>Bakarus solemnly continues, "Kai waited for Leya's sorrow to abate, but it never did..."</b>

<b>Bakarus quietly narrates, "Leya wandered the lands for many cycles of the moons, grief her only companion."</b>

<b>Bakarus forcefully concludes, "She was confronted with the power of Luukos and for all her gifts, she was powerless to do anything about it."</b>

Arelder frowns.

<b>Bakarus recites:</b>

   <b> "Thus we conclude the tragic tale of Leya and Egan."</b>

Yunni lets out a long, contemplative breath.

Luxelle sighs.

Arbeia sighs.

Jaired shakes his head.

Grhim adopts an agreeable expression.

.

Amused, Naamit bows slightly and offers brief acknowledgement by inclining her head.

Kothos applauds Bakarus.

Rahj lets out a cheer!

You perform a bow characteristic of the Evashiran.

Arbeia nods at Arelder.

Luxelle says, "What a wondrous telling. I would cheer for the players, but the scene is still so somber in my heart."

Bakarus glances at Peatwyn.

<b>Bakarus confidently says, "He would bow if he could."</b>

Jaired praises Peatwyn.

Lylia says, "I do not know that I can restore him, but I can allow him to take a bow..."

Cryheart nods at Luxelle.

Rahj exclaims, "Encore! Encore!!"

Lylia winks at Naamit.

Missoni nods encouragingly at Peatwyn.

<i>Cryheart waves one of Peatwyn's arms.</i>

Ibar whispers aloud, "Truely dedicated to the role.."

Ibar glances at Peatwyn.

Riend slowly empties her lungs.

Lylia nods at Ibar.

The ghostly voice of Peatwyn says, "What matters most is the craft."

Zeminar nods at Bakarus.

Ibar breaks out in a silly grin.

You smile at Peatwyn.

Kothos touches Peatwyn.

Jaired applauds Zeminar.

Tikba nods slowly at Peatwyn.

Speaking approvingly to Peatwyn, Missoni says, "Quite so."

Lylia walks toward Peatwyn.

Speaking to Peatwyn, Traiva says, "And you have truly dedicated yourself to it."

Zeminar rubs Peatwyn.

Lylia begins to do her best to bandage Peatwyn's wounded left arm.

Cryheart says, "Devotion to love can be tragic at times."

Naamit stares at Peatwyn's lifeless body, apparently lost in thought.
