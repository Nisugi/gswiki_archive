<hr/>
<p>[Icemule Trace, Town Center - 2300] (u4042150)
</p><p>The center of the bustling frontier town is overseen by a sturdy mule statue carved from glacial ice, which rises from the surrounding snow on a plinth of cold dark stone.  The sun's radiance filters through the ice, casting prismatic rays of light over a swirling throng.  Some halflings chatter loudly by a colorful silver-bound barrel emblazoned with a row of tiny grey penguins, while others recline on colorful cloaks spread out across the hard ground.  Over by a smooth dark stone bench, a roaring bonfire crackles merrily, lending its warmth to the surroundings.  You also see the Gwenlow disk, the granite Jivan disk, a lesser bay owl that is flying around, the fiery red Vendayan disk, a red-eyed fire wyrdling, the Fropple disk, the Feagol disk, a snowy-eared sable wolfhound, a rock ptarmigan that is flying around, the red Aetherwind disk, the white Netherwinds disk, the Recyr disk, a blue and white pavilion and a blued steel wastebin.
</p><p>Also here: Great Lady Gwenlow, Anskeirra, Jivan, High Lord Fokas, Vendayan, Tevil, Mister Polveiss who is sitting, Yanik, Fropple, Vaikeses who is sitting, Keirwynn, Feagol, Aetherwind, Arena Hero Netherwinds, Recyr
</p><p>Obvious paths: north, east, south, west
</p><p>Gwenlow sits down.
</p><p>Fropple turns to you and cheers!
</p><p>Fropple turns to you and cheers!
</p><p>Fropple frowns at Tevil.
</p><p>Vaikeses says, "I can tell you more jokes."
</p><p>You smile at Fropple.
</p><p>You say, speaking to Fropple, "Good afternoon."
</p><p>Gwenlow grabs an uncut diamond from inside her grey wolf fur satchel.
</p><p>Gwenlow put an uncut diamond in her black purse.
</p><p>Gwenlow grabs a large platinum nugget from inside her grey wolf fur satchel.
</p><p>Gwenlow put a large platinum nugget in her black purse.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Yes yes hallos Grand Lady."
</p><p>Folding his left arm behind his back and dipping to one knee, Fropple bows respectfully to you and inclines his head.
</p><p>Gwenlow removes an uncut diamond from in her black purse.
</p><p>Gwenlow absent-mindedly drops an uncut diamond into her grey wolf fur satchel.
</p><p>Gwenlow removes a petrified mammoth tusk from in her black purse.
</p><p>Gwenlow absent-mindedly drops a petrified mammoth tusk into her grey wolf fur satchel.
</p><p>Fropple says, "I got your letter."
</p><p>Raythiel arrives, guided by an urchin, who nods to Raythiel and quickly takes off.
</p><p>Tevil asks, "Who wants to shower me with uncut diamonds?"
</p><p>Gwenlow removes a large platinum nugget from in her black purse.
</p><p>Gwenlow absent-mindedly drops a large platinum nugget into her grey wolf fur satchel.
</p><p>Fropple says, "We should chat."
</p><p>Gwenlow removes a large platinum nugget from in her black purse.
</p><p>Gwenlow absent-mindedly drops a large platinum nugget into her grey wolf fur satchel.
</p><p>You exclaim, speaking to Fropple, "Wonderful!"
</p><p>Fropple nods enthusiastically!
</p><p>Fropple nods enthusiastically!
</p><p>Vendayan says, "Oh.  I'm supposed to be writing one."
</p><p>Raythiel flags down a nearby urchin and exchanges a few words.
</p><p>The urchin nods to Raythiel and takes off, with Raythiel in tow.
</p><p>Vendayan rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>You say, speaking to Fropple, "When would be a good time for you."
</p><p>Vaikeses nods to you in greeting.
</p><p>Fropple chuckles.
</p><p>You wave to Vaikeses.
</p><p>Vendayan just went south.
</p><p>You give Vaikeses a lingering kiss on the cheek.
</p><p>Vaikeses's cheeks flush with a soft pale rose shade, darkening his freckles even more.
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Does you has time now? or it too soon?"
</p><p>You exclaim, "I have time!"
</p><p>Tevil renews his songs.
</p><p>You join Fropple.
</p><p>Fluster just arrived.
</p><p>A moping mountain spirit floats in, following Fluster.
</p><p>You gently rub one of the statue's legs.  Although the glacial ice is cold, it does not burn your skin, and something about the play of light within the statue's crystalline construction reminds you tantalizingly of happy days now past.
</p><p>Fluster gestures while calling upon the lesser spirits for aid...
</p><p>Fropple says, "We go quiet spot."
</p><p>Fluster gestures into the air.
</p><p>Fluster gets a frustrated look on his face.
</p><p>Finston just arrived.
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Finston just went west.
</p><p>Finston just arrived.
</p><p>Finston just went south.
</p><p>Fropple just skipped merrily south, followed by several bemused companions.
</p>
<hr/><p>WE travel all the way to Honeybeer Inn.---
</p><p>Fropple just skipped merrily east, followed by several bemused companions.
</p><p>[Honeybeer Inn, Dining Room - 3450] (u4043221)
</p><p>A large stone hearth dominates one wall, with several roasts at different stages of completion turning on the spit.  The day's diners have emptied an oak sideboard of its wealth of food, leaving behind only bare platters.  Several halflings lounge in chairs around the old wooden tables spaced haphazardly across the dining room.
</p><p>Also here: Fropple
</p><p>Obvious exits: west
</p><p>Fropple says, "This my inn."
</p><p>You giggle.
</p><p>You say, "Im bemused."
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Fropple searches around for a moment.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Yes yes, I am your counselor now."
</p><p>You nod enthusiastically!
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>You exclaim, "I'm Innocent!"
</p><p>Fropple adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Yes of course, that is why you come to Fropple."
</p><p>Fropple says, "It the halfling way to defend at the court of law, protect you."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Many things to consider."
</p><p>You say, speaking to Fropple, "They say they have evidence."
</p><p>Fropple frowns.
</p><p>You pick idly at some sleek selshis skin gloves with kelyn-reinforced knuckles.
</p><p>Fropple says, "First you must be careful who you talk with."
</p><p>Fropple says, "If it is official talk, then I insist you summon me at once and direct official trial question to me."
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>You nod.
</p><p>Fropple says, "You has right to silence, not to have to say something, all have this right."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Now, I will always keep your secret."
</p><p>Fropple says, "You must tell me what going on, so I can plan defense."
</p><p>You gaze in wonder at your surroundings.
</p><p>[Honeybeer Inn, Dining Room - 3450] (u4043221)
</p><p>A large stone hearth dominates one wall, with several roasts at different stages of completion turning on the spit.  The day's diners have emptied an oak sideboard of its wealth of food, leaving behind only bare platters.  Several halflings lounge in chairs around the old wooden tables spaced haphazardly across the dining room.  You also see the Fropple disk.
</p><p>Also here: Fropple
</p><p>Obvious exits: west
</p><p>Fropple asks, "What is accusation?"
</p><p>Fropple asks, "You make bad tradings?"
</p><p>You say, "The Mayor has accused me of sharing the Secret of the White Wyrn to the Vaalorians."
</p><p>You say, "Before it was released."
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>You say, "The Mayor told Me, Sorlu, and Roelon in private.. About his building it in secret."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Vaalor founds out, and they think you tolds."
</p><p>Fropple says, "When you tradings."
</p><p>Fropple asks, "This is what they think?"
</p><p>You say, "They think I told the king, when I passed a note to the kings guard, for the king."
</p><p>You shuffle your feet.
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>You say, "Me and the King are kinda friends."
</p><p>You hold up two fingers and slowly pinch them together until they are almost touching.
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Kings Qalinor, or High Legionnaire?"
</p><p>You say, "King Qalinor."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Ohh."
</p><p>Fropple says, "You famous."
</p><p>Fropple chuckles.
</p><p>You wave your hand in a dismissive gesture.
</p><p>You say, "We danced and chatted."
</p><p>You lean forward.
</p><p>Fropple chuckles.
</p><p>You quietly say, "He's a good  danger."
</p><p>You say, "Er dancer."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Yes yes, many have said this rumor."
</p><p>Your cheeks flush with a soft pale rose shade, darkening your freckles even more.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Ohhhohoho."
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Did Falvicar get maddy mad when you dance?"
</p><p>A pained expression crosses Fropple's face.
</p><p>You say, "No no. King asked Falvicar's permission."
</p><p>You nod enthusiastically!
</p><p>Fropple says, "Sorry, I must ask many questions. It will halp me determine my strategies."
</p><p>Fropple searches around for a moment.
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>You say, "I understand."
</p><p>Fropple asks, "What was in note?"
</p><p>You say, "The note I passed the king.. was.. let me see if I can remember the wording."
</p><p>You ponder.
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Fropple asks, "And does anyone have note?"
</p><p>You say, "The king does."
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Fropple rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>You say, "I don't know if anyone else does."
</p><p>You ponder.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Yes yes, tell me the wordings..."
</p><p>Fropple inclines his ear, listening intently.
</p><p>Fropple turns an inquisitive ear toward you.
</p><p>You say, "I don't think the king would pass the note to anyone else."
</p><p>You say, "Except maybe his trusted leadership."
</p><p>Fropple nods slowly.
</p><p>You say, "So I started with Dear King Qalinor,"
</p><p><br/>
You recite:
</p>
<pre>   "Mayor Talliver will be writing a letter to you asking to deliberate with you personally.   Sadly he is still set on asking for a change in the airships traveling over Icemule."
</pre>
<p>(Fropple listens intently.)
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Fropple removes a silver-tipped black crow quill from in his tart satchel.
</p><p>You recite:
</p>
<pre>   "Please becareful. If you agree, always keep your guards around you.  I fear for your safety and for the airships safety."
</pre>
<p>Fropple removes a frost blue parchment from in his tart satchel.
</p><p>(Fropple writes a note.)
</p><p>Turning the black crow quill over, Fropple's face flashes briefly with pain and you notice that his silver-tipped quill has drawn blood from his palm.
</p><p>You say, "And I signed it."
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>A pale white aura dances across your plumille houppelande.
</p><p>You say, "Nothing about the White Wyrm."
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>You sigh softly.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Yes yes, indeed not."
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Why do they think you told specifically about White Wyrm? Beside note, how did it come up?"
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Did someone from Vaalor say something about Wyrm?"
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>You say, speaking to Fropple, "The Mayor just said it was an informant his own spies in Vaalor."
</p><p>(Fropple appears deep in thought while pacing about.)
</p><p>You say, "So saw me pass the note at the dance."
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Oke."
</p><p>You say, speaking to Fropple, "There is a thing."
</p><p>You bite your lip.
</p><p>You say, "I made something special for the Mayor."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Of course, tell Fropple all."
</p><p>Fropple says, "It best if we tell now, rather than be surprise  in front of Judge."
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Fropple asks, "What is the special?"
</p><p>Fropple frets.
</p><p>You say, "So with all these new trade deals and Icemule growing and become important.."
</p><p>Fropple frets.
</p><p>(Fropple scribbes more and more notes.)
</p><p>(Fropple scribbes more and more notes.)
</p><p>Fropple frets.
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>You say, "I created a coin.."
</p><p>Fropple rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>You say, "Something to represent Icemule."
</p><p>Fropple applauds.
</p><p>You say, "I was going to present it to the Mayor when he Announced the White Wyrm."
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>You say, "But ...."
</p><p>You say, "I can't find it."
</p><p>Fropple rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Hrmsies."
</p><p>Fropple asks, "What on coin?"
</p><p>Turning the black crow quill over, Fropple's face flashes briefly with pain and you notice that his silver-tipped quill has drawn blood from his palm.
</p><p>You say, "It was beautiful Fropple."
</p><p>You say, "Im afraid to say."
</p><p><br/>
Your cheeks flush with a soft pale rose shade, darkening your freckles even more.
</p><p><br/>
You shuffle your feet.
</p><p>You say, "It was a beautiful an embossed silver coin."
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Fropple says, "I'm sorry we lostses it."
</p><p>Fropple shuffles his feet.
</p><p>Fropple shuffles his feet.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Okie."
</p><p>You say, "And when you looked at the coin.."
</p>
<pre>You say, "you see, "The flat silver metalic disk is embossed with a tiny pure white airship seemingly set for battle. Engraved in the common language around the bottom edge of the coin with the words "The White Wyrm." Turning the coin over you see the embossed image of a small snowy town the details so fine it looks almost to come alive. Engraved around the top edge in common is "Icemule Trace"."
</pre>
<p>Fropple rubs his chin thoughtfully.
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Hrm."
</p><p>Fropple says, "I wonder where coin is."
</p><p>You ask, "Doesn't sound beautiful?"
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>Fropple exclaims, "Yes yes, very nice!"
</p><p>Fropple asks, "You think someone in Vaalor has?"
</p><p>Fropple frets.
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Could you have lost it there?"
</p><p>Fropple frets.
</p><p>You exclaim, "I was really hoping to give it to the Mayor... I must have!"
</p><p>Fropple frets.
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>You exclaim, "I sent more than one correspendance!"
</p><p>(Fropple jots more notes down.)
</p><p>Fropple asks, "You think it could have been in letter?"
</p><p>You gawk at Fropple.
</p><p>You feel the blood drain from your face.
</p><p>You exclaim, "Could it be!"
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>You say, "Oh my goodness oh my goodness."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Let us not speculations."
</p><p>You say, "I did send a letter the High Legionaire before the dance."
</p><p>Fropple says, "But I must prepare for all possibilities."
</p><p>(Fropple gets a steely resolve on his face.)
</p><p>You say, "It was a same kind of letter as to the king."
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Fropple says, "I finds."
</p><p>Fropple says, "I finds."
</p><p>Fropple says, "I could talk to him."
</p><p>You say, "That was said..different."
</p><p>You say, "This is what I said in that letter."
</p><p>A cloud of dense silvery fog suddenly appears.  The fog quickly dissipates to reveal Falvicar.
</p><p>Falvicar strikes a heroic pose.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<pre>You say, "I bring you news from icemule though not good. Our Mayor is going to write to the King requesting audience. I think the two men are due for a discussion.   Our mayor is highly well know I hope his audience is granted and we can finally have all these matters resolved. I am afraid with our letters disappearing that his letter like the last with the request for the delegation will not make it to its intended target.  I only want peace."
</pre>
<p>Turning the black crow quill over, Fropple's face flashes briefly with pain and you notice that his silver-tipped quill has drawn blood from his palm.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Yes yes hallos."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Fropple, counselor at law."
</p><p>Fropple gives Falvicar a firm handshake.
</p><p>Fropple gives Falvicar a firm handshake.
</p><p>Falvicar waves to Fropple.
</p><p>Falvicar and Fropple shake hands.
</p><p>Fropple says, "We are discussing case...."
</p><p>You say, speaking to Falvicar, "My darling Fropple agreed to represent me and we are talking about my case."
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>You wrap your arms around Falvicar and rest your head on his shoulder.
</p><p>Falvicar leans over and whispers, "I'm sorry if I interuptted  just miss you."
</p><p>Falvicar hangs his head.
</p><p>You say, speaking to Falvicar, "Your welcome to stay."
</p><p>You wrap Falvicar in a tender embrace.
</p><p>Falvicar nods.
</p><p>Falvicar nods.
</p><p>Falvicar wraps you in a tender embrace.
</p><p>You exclaim, speaking to Falvicar, "But behave!"
</p><p>You giggle.
</p><p>Falvicar looks at you and hums.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Yes, I has studied these laws of our people, I will zealously defend Opalina in the courts."
Falvicar obviously doesn't realize you can see him scratching under his black and grey kilt.
</p><p>Falvicar snickers.
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Falvicar coyly says, "Ohhh okay."
</p><p>Falvicar grins.
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Has they told you of any evidence they intend to use?"
</p><p>You shake your head.
</p><p>(Fropple jots more notes.)
</p><p>Fropple says, "Okie."
</p><p>You say, "Just that they saw me passing a note at the dance."
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Is there anyone else who could halps our case?"
</p><p>You pace back and forth.
</p><p>You say, "Maybe the High Legionaire."
</p><p>You exclaim, "Oh my .. What if It was me Fropple!"
</p><p>Fropple says, "Aureliano."
</p><p>Falvicar looks rather confused.
</p><p>&gt;nod fropple
</p><p>You nod at Fropple.
</p><p>Fropple rubs you tenderly.
</p><p>Fropple rubs you tenderly.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Okie it okie, we figures it out."
</p><p>You bury your face in your hands.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Okie."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Then I think we do this."
</p><p>You say, "I was thinking of having another one made because I lost that one.. But now.."
</p><p><br/>
You feel the blood drain from your face.
</p><p>Fropple says, "But you are boss, I only your advisor and representings."
</p><p>You listen carefully to Fropple.
</p><p>Falvicar ponders.
</p><p>Falvicar glances to his left.
</p><p>Falvicar glances to his right.
</p><p>Fropple says, "I think we start a public bolsterings of your case, and I will spread the message that the charges are false."
</p><p>Fropple says, "I will do so quite openly if you desire."
</p><p>You nod at Fropple.
</p><p>Fropple says, "I well liked in town, many will believe me."
</p><p>Turning the black crow quill over, Fropple's face flashes briefly with pain and you notice that his silver-tipped quill has drawn blood from his palm.
</p><p>Falvicar asks, "Trial is next week I believe aye?"
</p><p>Fropple says, "We will deny all charges of treasions and misconducts plainly."
</p><p>Fropple put a frost blue parchment in his tart satchel.
</p><p>Fropple put a silver-tipped black crow quill in his tart satchel.
</p><p>You nod.
</p><p>Falvicar says, "After the commune then I'm guessing."
</p><p>Fropple says, "And I will aggressively defend any comments from accuers, while discrediting any accusations and accusers, and immediately demand all evidence against you."
</p><p>You shrug at Falvicar.
</p><p>Fropple says, "This will serve to find out the case against you, and to help our strategy."
</p><p>You say, "It's either before or after."
</p><p>You say, "Or next week."
</p><p>Falvicar says, "'by next week I meant the 8th."
</p><p>Fropple says, "I will also seek out the High Legionnaire and request to interview him, and if it is favorable, I will summon him for trials."
</p><p>You slowly and deliberately empty your filled lungs.
</p><p>Falvicar says, "9:30 elven time night."
</p><p>You nod at Fropple.
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Okie, follow up question."
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Is there a way to blame someone else?"
</p><p>Falvicar chuckles to himself.
</p><p>You ponder.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Sorlu sneaky."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Maybe Grutak blab."
</p><p>You say, speaking to Fropple, "Grutak didn't know."
</p><p>You say, "But Sorlu did."
</p><p>You say, "IF Sorlu told Grutak.."
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>You say, "Of course Grutak would brag."
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>You say, "And both of them were VERY quick to want to string me up."
</p><p>Fropple frowns.
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>You ponder.
</p><p>Fropple paces back and forth.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Yes yes, they have motives."
</p><p><br/>
You say, "Come to think of it.. Grutak didn't even seem too surprised about the Airship when it showed up."
</p><p>Falvicar nods.
</p><p><br/>
You say, speaking to Falvicar, "I don't know though.. I don't think they would want to hurt Icemule really.. They do want a war.. but.. are they that.. Salty."
</p><p>Fropple nods.
</p><p>Falvicar asks, speaking to you, "If that were true, then why do they want a war with Vaalor?"
</p><p>Fropple says, "Grutak just like war."
</p><p>Fropple says, "And fight."
</p><p>Fropple chuckles.
</p><p>Falvicar says, speaking to you, "It doesn't a genious to figure out we'd get our arses handed to us."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Sorlu want power."
</p><p>Falvicar shrugs.
</p><p>Fropple says, "It easy."
</p><p>Fropple leans against an oak sideboard.
</p><p>Falvicar nods.
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Does you has any question?"
</p><p>Fropple rubs his tailored cloak.
</p><p>You shake your head.
</p><p>Fropple asks, "Is anything else you want me to do?"
</p><p>You say, "I will call for you straight away if someone tries to accuse me in public."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Yes yes, of courses."
</p><p>Falvicar wiggles his ears at you.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Okie."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Then I has work to do."
</p><p>Fropple's entire body tenses as he clenches his fist.
</p><p>You hug Fropple.
</p><p>Falvicar nods.
</p><p>Fropple pounds both his fists against his chest.
</p><p>You exclaim, "Thank you so much!"
</p><p>Fropple hugs you, and you wrap him in a warm embrace.
</p><p>Fropple lets out a cheer!
</p><p>Fropple says, "Yes yes, welcomes."
</p><p>Fropple says, "I hope I does very goods for you. I will work very hard."
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Fropple whispers, "Yes."
</p><p>Falvicar nods.
</p><p>You say, "Well in a few days  time. I'll send you a message to confirm the day and time."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Okie."
</p><p>Fropple says, "Just let me know when."
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Fropple adjusts his field plate, reinforcing weak spots.
</p><p>You nod.
</p><p>Fropple smiles.
</p><p>Fropple clasps your hand, and you shake it enthusiastically in return.
</p><p>Fropple gives Falvicar a firm handshake.
</p><p>Fropple says, "Good day, and I look forward to hearing from you."
</p><p>Fropple waves.
</p><p>Fropple just skipped merrily west.
</p><p>You wave.
</p><p>Falvicar waves.
