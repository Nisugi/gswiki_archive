The veil of leaves above parts toward the outer edge of the grounds, flooding the grove with pure moonlight.  Nurtured by natural sustenance, a scattering of miniature lemon trees release an ambrosial citrus fragrance in the air.  The ends of a few branches are carefully pruned on an angle, a reverent gesture toward the Lady's plentiful gifts.
Also here: Sirona, Dwi, Sir Guarrin, Swampwort, Zeminar, Bakarus, Magister Raelee, Lord Lorcrest, Sister-in-arms Mourdeyan, Peatwyn, Protector Kilthal, Sir Cryheart, Kippe, Lady Cylnthia, Squire Delindra, Granfenberg, Telare, Jisandra
Obvious paths: east, southwest, down

Swampwort says, "Kuon's presence is not here, but anywhere plants grow is a fine place to speak of my Patron."

<b>Bakarus cordially says, "First and foremost… Eternal Light, friends."</b>

Cylnthia bows her head and chants a short prayer, causing golden brown and green light to momentarily coalesce in front of her.

Kilthal glances at a coiled serpent candle.

Lorcrest strides a few steps forward.

Lorcrest moves over to Bakarus and stands ready to guard him from attack.

You echo, "Eternal Light, First Pilgrim."

Speaking to Bakarus, Cylnthia repeats, "Eternal Light."

<b>Bakarus recites:</b>
<b>"Thank you all for gathering here this evening.  Certainly thank you to Cairnfang for hosting such a wonderful few days of activities. We all seek warmth and light during this time of the year."</b>

Speaking raspily to Bakarus, Zeminar says, "Eternal light."

Zeminar nods.

Peatwyn exclaims, "Eternal Light!"

<b>Bakarus says, "I understand if many of you do not know me, I tend to stay among the temples where I am most comfortable. My name is Bakarus Klysus, a pilgrim in the Order of Eternal Light."</b>

The serpent candle flickers softly, casting a warm light throughout the area.

<b>Bakarus informally says, "Tonight's session will be a short discussion regarding Kuon and some of the other spirits we acknowledge and worship in these lands. I wished to share some general knowledge of what we might call lesser spirits or Arkati."</b>

Swampwort bows his head and chants a short prayer, causing gold and brown light to momentarily coalesce in front of him.

<b>Bakarus says, "I also wish to point out that if any of you have knowledge or experiences regarding Kuon or the spirits in general, please share them at any time. This is an open discussion."</b>

Bakarus points at Swampwort.

Cylnthia smiles.

Swampwort nods slowly.

<b>Bakarus says, "I am pleased to have learned that one among us is of Kuon."</b>

Bakarus applauds Swampwort.

Speaking to Bakarus, Swampwort says, "I yield to the host."

A faint, flickering light emanates from a coiled serpent candle, warming the area with its glow.

Telare grins.

<b>Bakarus says, "I tend to avoid the term lesser as these beings are far beyond our own power and have been granted some level of immortality. Understanding that the word immortal causes great debate and disagreement, I mean it in the sense that these beings do not perish through age or disease or common causes that end life here as we know it."</b>

Cylnthia says, "I followed Kuon for quite some time, myself, as well. Only recently did Imaera call me back to her fold."

<b>Bakarus concernedly says, "Ahh."</b>

Swampwort adopts an agreeable expression.

<b>Bakarus says, "Well."</b>

The angry shriek of an owl suddenly erupts from near Cryheart.

<b>Bakarus says, "I began thinking about Kuon for two reasons recently. One, I simply realized that I needed to learn more about these divine spirits as I spend much of my time studying the Liabo pantheon. Second, as I look across the lands there are times that I fear Lady Imaera may be withdrawing from us. Undead roam in new areas trampling nature underfoot and forests seeming to decay and wither in front of our eyes."</b>

<b>Speaking to Cylnthia, Bakarus says, "I hope your lady shines her light, truly."</b>

Bakarus nods at Cylnthia.

A coiled serpent candle burns with a warm golden light.

Cylnthia nods at Bakarus.

Zeminar turns an inquisitive ear toward Bakarus.

<b>Bakarus says, "But that is a discussion for another time."</b>

Cylnthia says, "Every minute and day, she does."

<b>Bakarus says, "Perhaps in these dark times a spirit such as Kuon may become more important to us."</b>

Swampwort nods slowly.

<b>Bakarus simply says, "Kuon is often depicted as a giantman and is said to have been blessed by Imaera in the days following the Ur-Daemon war. Legend says he knelt beside Imaera to aid in the regrowth and healing of the flora of the land. Due to this, Imaera blessed certain herbs to have healing properties which are commonly known to us today."</b>

Cylnthia nods in agreement at Bakarus.

<b>Bakarus says, "Acantha, Ambrominas and Basal being the most referred to in the literature I could find. Though, I should add in an interesting and likely incorrect theory I was told regarding acantha leaf - the herb known as Deathwort."</b>

Dwi blinks.

Peatwyn gasps.

The serpent candle burns warmly, lending a soft light to the surroundings.

<b>Bakarus says, "An alchemist I spoke to believes that Deathwort is some sort of poisonous perversion of the Acantha leaf. I for one have never seen Deathwort and believe the tales of its existence to be far-fetched, likely conjured up in an effort to frighten."</b>

Peatwyn blushes a glowing shade of red.

Bakarus shrugs.

Bakarus glances at Peatwyn.

Telare grins.

Zeminar nods slowly.

Cylnthia says, "Very interesting."

Swampwort shakes his head.

<b>Bakarus says, "Legend also states that as Kuon walks, despite being a giantman of immense size, that flowers grow beneath his footsteps and no plants are ever crushed by his passing."</b>

Cylnthia nods at Bakarus.

Swampwort says, "Most herbs called worts are healing herbs, such as my namesake."

<b>Bakarus interestedly says, "On a quick side note regarding herbs, and I must disclose that I am no herbalist or alchemist, I did find this nearby and believe it may have healing properties."</b>

Bakarus taps a glistening viper thorn, which is in his right hand.

Bakarus carefully places a glistening viper thorn on the ground.

<b>Bakarus says, "Whoever wishes."</b>

Cylnthia gazes thoughtfully at a glistening viper thorn.

Dwi rubs her chin thoughtfully.

Cylnthia squints at a glistening viper thorn.

Zeminar pores over a glistening viper thorn, engrossed in the study of it.

<b>Bakarus says, "I will leave it here for any who may want to use it on the sick and infirmed."</b>

Dwi grunts at the thorn possessively, glaring at the same time!

Peatwyn says, "Like as if from a rose."

Telare takes a drink from his dry Selanthia merlot.

<b>Bakarus says, "Admittedly, it was difficult to find information tying directly to Kuon's presence being seen or directly noticed here in our surrounding areas. I was able to speak with a few from Icemule who recalled a time when a giantman from the Wsalamir clan visited the town. He was a cleric of Kuon, but his name seems to have faded into history. From what I could gather at the time, he either helped build or purified a well there, though this was decades ago. Apparently his magic was significant and truly in the healing spirit that Kuon would champion and represent."</b>

<b>Bakarus wonderingly asks, "Again, I am curious if anyone has any anecdotes or tales related to Kuon that I did not uncover during my research?"</b>

Cylnthia says, "The empathic spell Regeneration was given to empaths by Kuon."

Peatwyn asks, "Are most of his stories originating from the north?"

Speaking heartily to Bakarus, Dwi asks, "Issit true he's Aiea's baby?"

Dwi grunts, amused.

Cylnthia says, "He came at the height of a wasting sickness that was affecting empaths, and taught them how to overcome it."

<b>Speaking to Dwi, Bakarus says, "I do not believe so, no.  However I do wish to discuss their similarities in a moment."</b>

Swampwort says, "One thing I did not note, of mention."

(Telare swirls the wine around a bit in his glass.)

Kippe thoughtfully specifies, "A ranger's ability to regrow herbs in a location -may- be a gift from Kuon."

Cylnthia nods at Kippe.

<b>Bakarus says, "And thank you for sharing, certainly."</b>

Swampwort says, "Is that Kuon will be with us so long as there is a single green leaf still alive on Elanthia.

<b>Bakarus says, "I was also informed that House Sovyn has a wonderful herb garden dedicated to Kuon that I was able to visit. The statues there are quite remarkable, dedicated to Imaera and Kuon. I would highly recommend seeing it, if you are able."</b>

Speaking to Kippe, Cylnthia says, "Indeed, that would be quite the gift from Him. As would an empath's ability to grow herbs as well."

The black ora prayerbeads around Bakarus's neck is momentarily engulfed in a shroud of darkness!

<b>Bakarus asks, "I can assume most here are familiar with the Dragonspine Fane and its relevance as a common pilgrimage for worshippers of all faiths?"</b>

Bakarus glances around the area.

<b>Bakarus says, "I believe it is worth noting that the fifth stair on the journey contains both depictions of Kuon and Aeia side by side. Similar color schemes are evident, and while Kuon seems to represent the more curated and kept side of nature, Aeia's realm is more distinctly wild and lush in nature."</b>

<b>Bakarus says, "Aeia, of course, being a local deity mostly worshipped in River's Rest, but I have known many who have found comfort in her spirit. The two seem to represent slightly different aspects of nature, healing and regrowth. Though in the case of Aeia, I could not find a definitive theory of her origin story. If anyone here has heard tales or legends regarding that matter, I would be more than happy to hear them."</b>

Telare nods understandingly.

Dwi concernedly asks, "Wait...Am I bout to join a cult?"

Dwi surveys the area.

Kippe smiles at Bakarus.

<b>Speaking to Dwi, Bakarus says, "Too late my friend."</b>

<b>Bakarus knowingly says, "I understand there are far too many of these local or "lesser" spirits to give a comprehensive discussion on in one sitting, and I doubt anyone would want to sit for that long.  However, I do encourage everyone to take time to learn and understand these forces that shape our lives. There are many to explore and learn about, no matter how seemingly small or insignificant they may appear to be at first glance. Meyno, Tilamaire and Voln come to mind."</b>

Swampwort says, "All who live could be considered members of Kuon's following, especially if they use herbs."

Bakarus agrees with Swampwort.

Cryheart takes a drink from his spring water.

<b>Bakarus says, "The Huntress for instance..."</b>

<b>Bakarus says, "I am also quite pleased to know more than a few who consider The Huntress to be their patron deity. Her legend is remarkable as it ties into Arachne and her fierce demeanor draws those who feel a certain thrill when on the hunt. We in fact have a few in our Order."</b>

Peatwyn chants a short but reverent orison, asking to have rightful vengeance delivered upon the deserving.

Swampwort nods at Peatwyn.

Peatwyn says, "May her horns ring across the valleys of time."

Kippe gazes up into the sky.

<b>Bakarus says, "Before we depart, I do have something I wish to give away to thank you all for your attendance this evening.  It is a serene painting of nature done by our very own Sister, Meliyara."</b>

<b>Bakarus says, "I have never done trivia, so I figured we should give it a try in an informal setting."</b>

Peatwyn smiles playfully.

Bakarus nods respectfully to you.

Speaking to Bakarus, you whisper aloud, "We must still discuss the fee for the commission of this work."

<b>Bakarus says, "I believe it pays homage to Imaera, and moving forward in each of our events, I will be giving further editions away dedicated to the Liabo pantheon. My hope is that whoever wins it might have a place to display the piece or ability to share it with others. Perhaps even an enterprising art collector gains many in the series."</b>

You casually glance at Bakarus.

<b>Speaking to you, Bakarus says, "I have lawyers."</b>

You glance appraisingly at Zeminar.

Bakarus produces an elaborate gold-framed painting from the depths of his pale viridian cloak.

<b>Bakarus says, "We will do an easy bit of trivia, and the first to answer this question then earns the painting, if that is agreeable."</b>

<b>Bakarus recites:</b>
<b>"What trio of lesser spirits have no known symbols?"</b>

Cylnthia says, "Meyno, Khaarne, Illoke."

Bakarus produces a ruby-flecked Kuon figurine from the depths of his pale viridian cloak.

You nod approvingly at Cylnthia.

Peatwyn applauds.

Bakarus carefully places a ruby-flecked Kuon figurine on the ground.

You say, "Well done."

Swampwort gazes with interest at a ruby-flecked Kuon figurine.

<b>Speaking to Cylnthia, Bakarus asks, "So that everyone may share in the art, would you mind showing it about?"</b>

Bakarus offers Cylnthia an elaborate gold-framed painting.

Speaking to Bakarus, Cylnthia says, "Indeed."

Cylnthia accepts Bakarus's gold-framed painting.

Cylnthia recites:
    "At first glance, the canvas appears to depict an idyllic scene, rolling fields of green in the foreground giving way to a cheery farmer burning logs in the distance, a coil of smoke rising from the fire pit. Puffy white clouds in a lazy, clear sky add a touch of innocence and serenity. Upon closer inspection, the deep green of the grass hides small, bronze-colored snakes, slithering playfully. A discordant note is struck by the stack near the farmer, as it becomes clear that the stiff logs may not be wood."

Bakarus produces a burnished golden Kuon symbol from the depths of his pale viridian cloak.

Telare says, "Quite lovely."

Cylnthia recites:
    "It reads, 'The Work is Never Done'"

Swampwort accepts Bakarus's Kuon symbol.

Xanthalas grins.

Peatwyn ponders.

<b>Bakarus says, "This will conclude our brief discussion for this evening. Thank you to Cairnfang and the Order of Eternal Light whose Keepers and Seekers strive to gain knowledge and investigate Arkati activity in our world. If any have interest about learning more about the Order, please find myself, First Seeker Zeminar or any of our Brothers and Sisters.  All are more than capable of discussing what we do and membership into our group."</b>

Speaking to Bakarus, Swampwort says, "A fine representation."

Cryheart nods at Bakarus.

Zeminar nods once.

Telare says, "Thank you for hosting such an engaging discussion."

Speaking to Bakarus, Cylnthia says, "This will assuredly be put in a place of honor, in my home."

Speaking raspily to Bakarus, Zeminar says, "Eternal light friend.  Thank you for the lesson."

<b>Bakarus says, "Thank you all for taking the time."</b>

Peatwyn says, "Eternal Light.  May Phoen's brilliance illuminate every corner."
