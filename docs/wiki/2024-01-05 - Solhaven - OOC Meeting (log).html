<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Goal_List_for_2024">Goal List for 2024</span></h2>
<ul><li>Wizard's Guild
<ul><li>Will be completed by the Spring and ready for release</li>
<li>The grounds of the Wizard Guild will be open to all.</li>
<li>The portions of the Wizard Guild Tower will be open to the public.</li>
<li>Two contests will be held for the Wizard's Guild; one starting in January and one in February.</li></ul></li>
<li>Fishing Pier
<ul><li>There are several tables, carts, etc., on the South Haven Fishing Pier, that are missing any kind of items, despite the room description stating that items are for sale.  These items will become available very soon.</li></ul></li>
<li>Solhaven Bay Fishing
<ul><li>Fishing from boats will become available as soon as they clear QC.</li>
<li>Additional Fishing Docks will be created as soon as these fish clear.  They will be housed in the following rooms:
<ul><li>Abandoned Dock</li>
<li>Market Bridge</li>
<li>North 'Haven Quay</li>
<li>Charl's Quay</li>
<li>Fisherman's Quay</li>
<li>Fishmarket Pier</li>
<li>Bobo's Toy Park</li></ul></li>
<li>These will all access the same pool of fish.</li></ul></li>
<li>Trade Row
<ul><li>Pasha's Pavilion will be moving her tent to Trade Row, which will be getting an update.  Currently, there is nothing that takes place on Trade Row and it will start to see some changes to show it as a thriving trade community.
<ul><li>A contest will be run to get additional trading flavor added to the area.  The goal is to have ships unload in South Haven and deliveries to travel north.</li></ul></li>
<li>Expect to see construction and work happening around that area in the near future.</li></ul></li>
<li>Vornavis Caravansary
<ul><li>This area is getting an overhaul.</li>
<li>The mapping can be confusing.</li>
<li>As a way-station between the Sea of Fire Transport &amp; Vornavis, it feels like it should have more Tehir influences to it, specifically those of the Shakat.</li>
<li>There will be a contest for Tehir-themed items in the near future.</li></ul></li>
<li>Vornavis Proper Expansion
<ul><li>Now that Vornavis is open, a new area of it will be opened to allow for continued RP and to show imperial offerings.</li>
<li>It will include a few more shops, a new fountain, and connections to other areas within Vornavis.</li>
<li>While this is the Citizenship perk for those who have citizenship in Vornavis, once a month it will be opened to the public.  See below for details.</li></ul></li>
<li>Farmer's Markets
<ul><li>Goal: To highlight locations where players can come sell their wares.</li>
<li>Stock: Small Carts in a specific area that are open only during the days of the market.  Each cart will have nothing more than 5-10 items for sale.  There will be automated openings in each market: (ie: They will open on a Thursday night and close Sunday night.)</li>
<li>Ideology:
<ul><li>Marshtown Market - 3-4 stalls centered around items that the Marshfolk have to offer.  It will be a platform pier of 6-rooms that will allow players to place their stalls.</li>
<li>The Tehir Traders - 3-4 stalls centered around offerings of the Shakat.  This will be located in the Vornavian Caravansary and be a crescent-shaped market.</li>
<li>Fisherman's Faire - 3-4 stalls centered around the offerings of both fisherman and fish wives.  This will be located in South Haven on Trader's Row.  Unlike the other areas, this will be a series of carts that appear during the open market (along with a billboard at the top of the street) that create the market.</li>
<li>Vornavian Street Faire - 3-4 stalls centered around artwork and crafting.  These carts will be in the new Vornavis neighborhood.  During the 4-days of its opening, the guards will allow anyone to travel into the area.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Storylines
<ul><li>We will be continuing the Observations of a Magister umbrella storyline.  These will continue to be the small interactions with Odelgarde where she appraises the masses of what's taking place in the Empire, how things are going in Vornavis Keep, and any other small updates.
<ul><li>Example: Added Library books, Classes in the School, etc.</li></ul></li>
<li>Order of the Swan - Space and opportunities for RP will be introduced utilizing the Order of the Swan platform.  Starting in 2024, once a month, members of the Order of the Swan may request a Calendar Item be added to the calendar for an event and/or function that they wish to run.  This will boost the Order to the same functionality that the Legion has in the East.</li>
<li>Bayou Blues is, at the moment, on a hiatus, though I do anticipate having more stories of the people come out of here in the future.</li>
<li>Sou' o' the Bridges will be stories that feature items happening in South Haven.  They will be small stories, one-night peeks into the life of South Haveners.  Not all of them are crooks and scoundrels, though many of them are and you may find yourself tangled in some of their skullduggery.</li>
<li>Sands of Remembrance, slated to begin in February, will close out Grenhal's portion of the Nations on the Brink storyline and will start with representatives of the Tehir Tribe she belonged to coming to court, continue with her official burial ceremony, and then launch into mystery with her journal finally being able to be unlocked.</li>
<li>Shadowy Aybss is a storyline slated to start in April.</li>
<li>Emancipation of the Wyrdeep - Official Event - We have a lot planned for this event and as such we need time with our other duties to get this accomplished.  While this is not specifically a Solhaven Event, it is something that Vornavis will be asking to have representation for out that way, especially since Salnim is now the Sentinel of that area.</li>
<li>Storyline Clean-up in Solhaven that will take place in 2024:
<ul><li>Willhard - what is the final punishment of Willhard &amp; his place in Vornavis now?</li>
<li>Burial of Grenhal - This was noted above in Sands of Remembrance</li>
<li>Jairnsaxa's duties and continued life.</li>
<li>Malwind's health</li></ul></li>
<li>Global Storyline for 2024 - While I realize that the Global Storyline department is not centered out of Solhaven, I did figure I'd make a mention of it here since I am the one who is in charge of that.  This year's Global Storyline is the Chronicles of Norallen.  It started at the Kindred Games Festival and will continue once a month going forward.  The goal is to introduce the players to one-time locations and areas that will help paint a better picture of the world at large.  The planned method, though there may be changes to this as we develop, is to have the following:
<ul><li>Even-numbered Month
<ul><li>Vignette introducing the month's theme</li>
<li>2-3 RP interactions in a specified area</li>
<li>Vignette closing the month's theme</li>
<li>Introduction of a new "lore" snippet regarding a "race-specific relic."</li></ul></li>
<li>Odd-numbered Month
<ul><li>Vignette introducing the month's theme</li>
<li>NPC invitation to players to join the theme area for a weekend of "light" RP</li>
<li>Vignette closing the month's theme</li></ul></li>
<li>The Chronicles Wiki Page and Discord Forum will be updated as we go</li>
<li>Next Goal in the Storyline: Visit the Northern Fastness of the Wsalmir Clan</li></ul></li>
<li>The Clockwerke Devices Theme of the Year
<ul><li>Will Solhaven see something for this theme? The short answer is yes.</li></ul></li>
<li>The Year of the Rolton Theme
<ul><li>Solhaven didn't see much of an update in this area, what can we expect?
<ul><li>Petting Zoo will return, this will allow you to milk various animals in the petting zoo.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Stretch Goal for Solhaven
<ul><li>It really struck a discordant note with me during the various storylines that criticism was leveled at Vornavis for having "fallowed" fields.  The short answer to this is, yes, you are correct, the fields of Vornavis have been fallow for a long time.  Why?  While I realize this is a low-level hunting ground for daggerbeaks, it doesn't mean that we can't accomplish two things at once here.  So, my stretch goal for Solhaven – and I've no idea if I can accomplish it this year – will be to create a barn, clean up the fields, and have some seasonally changed room descriptions and activities for this area.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h2><span id="Player_Comment.2C_Questions.2C_and.2For_Concerns"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Player_Comment,_Questions,_and/or_Concerns">Player Comment, Questions, and/or Concerns</span></h2>
<p>Avrey recites:
</p><p>    "First, thank you for all of this!  Second, can we get something on the whiteboard about a cobbling place for Solhaven.  Third, you mentioned petting zoo coming back, is that permanently."
</p>
<ul><li>Cobbling Warehouse will likely be a 2025 Goal</li>
<li>Petting Zoo will be permanently open</li></ul>
<p>Alastir recites:
</p><p>    "Hi, long time listener, first time caller.  Can you help me understand why the bank is anti-magic/no-casting-allowed?  I think the Adventurer's Guild is the same."
</p>
<ul><li>A list of anti-magic rooms was provided and Thandiwe said she'd investigate the reasonings behind them.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Bank, Adv. Guild, Library, and Communitea</li></ul>
<p>Bristenn asks, "We have very few supernodes, and most are either camped by bots, covered in litter, or both.  If at all possible, could we see more in the town?"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "The area in the barbican is nice.  Vornavis Proper supernode would be fantastic."
</p>
<ul><li>Thandiwe said she'd look into it</li></ul>
<p>Perigourd says, "The first question was going to be about fishing, but you answered that and then some with far more than I hoped for, so thank you for that."
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "The second question is in relation to the Vornavis proper expansion and if it would be possible to get a tournament field added to that with an archery range, jousting list, and melee ring?"
</p>
<ul><li>This will be investigated and added to the desired list</li></ul>
<p>Perigourd says, "My final request is a habitual consideration for swan boats down the canal, for those midnight rendezvous."
</p>
<ul><li>This will be investigated and added to the desired list</li></ul>
<p>Speaking to you, Raelee asks, "When we say the new Wizard Guild is a satellite of the Hall... are we viewing this on the same level of the colleges in Tamzyrr, Nydds, Elstreth, Swale, etc... or is it a smaller Hall establishment?"
</p>
<ul><li>Small Establishment when compared to what the Hall of Mages has in the aforementioned areas.</li>
<li>Decent sized Guild for a Town</li></ul>
<p>Speaking to you, Raelee says, "And I guess I have a hope for storylines.  I'm really excited about what you've laid out, but the one thing I'd like to see is some emphasis on common goals and community building.  I think 2022 and 2023 have been really full of stories that were about conflict between groups of people, and it would be nice to take some of those groups and bring them back together."
</p>
<ul><li>It was commented that this is the goal for many of the towns this coming year and that many have already started to work towards that.</li></ul>
<p>Speaking to you, Raelee says, "Ultimately, everything sounds so great.  I really love that all of these new updates have really made this town feel *lived in".  Thus, all I have left is low-stakes requests: amongst the expansions in Vornavis... can we have a bench?  Some place to sit would be nice."
</p>
<ul><li>It was pointed out that you can seat/lean on the edge of the fountain.</li>
<li>The new neighborhood will have a bench.</li></ul>
<p>Yukito says, "My question is, for the new Clinic in South Haven, can we get a storage bin, please? My personal vote, also, is to remove the chalkboard and just keep the message board. I hate to bring in a rsour note, but already, we cannot post positive messages there without it being overwritten, so it's more of a bother than fun to interact with."
</p>
<ul><li>A storage bin for herbs will be added to the Free Clinic</li>
<li>A request is being submitted to the owner of the Chalkboard Script to see if permanent ones can be updated with various information.</li>
<li>It was suggested that the chalkboard in the Imperial Outpost be looked at as a possible option.</li></ul>
<p>Guarrin asks, "First off, thank you for the wonderful year and the fantastic outlook for next year. I have a few comments though. Earlier you mentioned that the goal for storylines was to have less conflict, does that cover all storylines? Just those within solhaven?"
</p>
<ul><li>Reiterated that many communities were currently handling cooperative RP</li></ul>
<p>Speaking to you, Guarrin says, "'Second, I'm glad Kenstrom is back because I am curious about the approach to aligning imperials between you both given the vast difference in how they are depicted depending on which town you are in."
</p>
<ul><li>It was mentioned that Kenstrom, Auchand, and Thandiwe speak frequently about matters of the Human Empire</li>
<li>It was also mentioned that a specific Human Empire meeting should be set up so as not to derail any of the Town Meetings.</li></ul>
<p>Lachonus asks, "First of all, amazing work!  My question was around the lingering items from the 2022 list on town ambient messaging. I d love to see more of this, especially near the ocean areas so that it feels that much more like a coastal vibe in those areas of town. Is that something we could perhaps squeeze some writing contests in around, if that would help lighten the writing load a bit and move it onto the 2024 list of wonder somehow?"
</p>
<ul><li>Specific request is for a return of the Mist on the Docks as the waves move, gulls and sea birds flying about, trade, idle chatter amid citizens, fog coming in and out of town due to the coastal weather.</li></ul>
<p>Jaysehn asks, "First, can I recommend that GMs do a session zero about their towns?"
</p>
<ul><li>Session Zeros are very complicated for a live game environment.  When you have 6-8 people at a DnD table, you can do that easily because you only have to taper the expectations of 6-8 people, we can have upwards of 50-100 people at our storylines.  It is unreasonable to do that and balance all those people.  However, how do you handle new people entering storylines?  There will be a bias if they weren't allowed to be at session zero for whatever reason and we don't want to exclude people.  I think we come a long way with updating the wiki to have a broad scope of information.  There also ends up this issue where if the players do or trigger something that changes the storyline, modifies, it now we've had a session zero that has to be altered.</li></ul>
<p>Jaysehn says, "I'd just like to request, as I did last year, that we not cast players, or the IC institutions they are aligned with, in the role of villains for other players to use as unwilling foils.I'm asking this of the staff in general. And thank you."
</p><p>Avrey says, "With the new stuff regarding Wyrdeep and its emancipation, how will that effect the borders that are currently mapped out?  I ask because I placed Avrey's village squished just bordering Wyrdeep and Dragach, and now I have no idea where she'd actually say she's from.  For reference, I'm looking at https://gswiki.play.net/images/gswiki/9/92/Tura_map.jpg in particular."
</p>
<ul><li>Avrey, I'm confused by your question -- slightly -- if it is a Human Village on the border of Bourth/Wyrdeep and Dragach then that is rather an anomoly.  The Wyrdeep has always been listed as a hive for elves and other non-human groups.  I would say that you have a lot of role playing opportunities if this was a human village in that area and that you would be considered part of the Wyrdeep nation unless you the border village decided to vote to be Dragach.</li></ul>
<p>Geijon says, "Let me see if I can fit my three. I really like the flavor of activity and the different decision making or locational community hijinks. Thanks."
</p><p>Geijon says, "Traders row and a lot of merchant stalls were mentioned. I like that. Will there be some mini festivals with those crystals and expanded options? I'm fond of those."
</p><p>Geijon asks, "Imperial life segway similar to the liveliness of areas. Vornavis as a daily double. The expansion of Vornavis, loved Perigourds comment. More simple or can we get a district name then the double is when will we get to the main gate of Vornavis and is that the wider vision?"
</p><p>Geijon says, "More simple meaning a general idea for the areas intent."
</p>
<ul><li>The Markets will be automated openings and will have both theme specific and stock items for sale.</li>
<li>Free Festivals are dropped to 2 a year and these markets will not be part of them.</li>
<li>The Markets will be:
<ul><li>Marshtown Market - 3-4 stalls centered around items that the Marshfolk have to offer.  It will be a platform pier of 6-rooms that will allow players to place their stalls.</li>
<li>The Tehir Traders - 3-4 stalls centered around offerings of the Shakat.  This will be located in the Vornavian Caravansary and be a crescent-shaped market.</li>
<li>Fisherman's Faire - 3-4 stalls centered around the offerings of both fisherman and fish wives.  This will be located in South Haven on Trader's Row.  Unlike the other areas, this will be a series of carts that appear during the open market (along with a billboard at the top of the street) that create the market.</li>
<li>Vornavian Street Faire - 3-4 stalls centered around artwork and crafting.  These carts will be in the new Vornavis neighborhood.  During the 4-days of its opening, the guards will allow anyone to travel into the area.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>Yukito says, "I was trying to lighten the mood a bit, but yes! Mollousks. Vornavian mollousks. Can we get seasilk more documented someday in the future? No rush. We already have wonderful Vornavian oranges."
</p><p>Yukito asks, "A not so serious inquiry. Seasilk! It's supposed to be an export. What is it made of? Is it from mollousks?"
</p>
<ul><li>Seasilk is an RL fabric made from a specific filament of mollusks</li>
<li>We can look into creating lore regarding the export</li></ul>
<p>Bristenn says, "Shandits."
</p>
<ul><li>There was much explanation about what a Shandit was</li>
<li>Basically, shan that were bandits</li>
<li>A request for more shan invasions</li></ul>

</p><p>     As a way-station between the Sea of Fire Transport &amp;amp
</p><p>      Vornavis, it feels like it should have more Tehir influences to it, specifically those of the Shakat.

</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Ideology:

</p><p>     The Tehir Traders - 3-4 stalls centered around offerings of the Shakat.  This will be located in the Vornavian Caravansary and be a crescent-shaped market.
</p><p>     Fisherman's Faire - 3-4 stalls centered around the offerings of both fisherman and fish wives.  This will be located in South Haven on Trader's Row.  Unlike the other areas, this will be a series of carts that appear during the open market (along with a billboard at the top of the street) that create the market.
</p><p>     Vornavian Street Faire - 3-4 stalls centered around artwork and crafting.  These carts will be in the new Vornavis neighborhood.  During the 4-days of its opening, the guards will allow anyone to travel into the area."

</p><p>Speaking to Avrey, Marstreforn says, "Those exist in the sea of fire."
</p><p>Lylia says, "That sounds like great fun; I can see putting aside some silvers and making the trip for markets."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Yup, big ol'sand fleas."
</p><p>You say, "The new neighborhood does not mean new Premium homes.  It is just the series of streets that will open."

</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Storylines
</p><p>     ;
</p><p>     We will be continuing the Observations of a Magister umbrella storyline.  These will continue to be the small interactions with Odelgarde where she appraises the masses of what's taking place in the Empire, how things are going in Vornavis Keep, and any other small updates.
</p><p>     Example: Added Library books, Classes in the School, etc."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Order of the Swan - Space and opportunities for RP will be introduced utilizing the Order of the Swan platform.  Starting in 2024, once a month, members of the Order of the Swan may request a Calendar Item be added to the calendar for an event and/or function that they wish to run.  This will boost the Order to the same functionality that the Legion has in the East."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I just read all that, wow."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Bayou Blues is, at the moment, on a hiatus, though I do anticipate having more stories of the people come out of here in the future."
</p><p>Ordim chants, "Babs babs babs!"
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Sou' o' the Bridges will be stories that feature items happening in South Haven.  They will be small stories, one-night peeks into the life of South Haveners.  Not all of them are crooks and scoundrels, though many of them are and you may find yourself tangled in some of their skullduggery."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Nice."
</p><p>Speaking to himself, Kippe says, "Mmm... skullduggery."
</p><p>Kothos says, "I'm always up for poking some skulls."
</p><p>You recite:

</p><p>Meliyara says, "If you gaze into the shadowy abyss, it gazes also into you."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Emancipation of the Wyrdeep - Official Event - We have a lot planned for this event and as such we need time with our other duties to get this accomplished.  While this is not specifically a Solhaven Event, it is something that Vornavis will be asking to have representation for out that way, especially since Salnim is now the Sentinel of that area."
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, you say, "Sure didn't."
</p><p>Zeminar raspily asks, "Shadowy?"
</p><p>Kothos says, "Abysses aren't filled with butterflies and glitter, usually."
</p><p>Speaking to Kothos, Missoni says, "Mine are."
</p><p>Akenna exclaims, "Excited for that!"
</p><p>Speaking to Kothos, Yukito says, "A butterfly and glitter abyss would be pretty horrifying."
</p><p>Speaking to Missoni, Kothos asks, "You have abysses?"
</p><p>Marstreforn says, "It sounds better than Fluffy Abyss of Hugs."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Storyline Clean-up in Solhaven that will take place in 2024:
</p><p>     Willhard - what is the final punishment of Willhard &amp;amp
</p><p>      his place in Vornavis now?
</p><p>     Burial of Grenhal - This was noted above in Sands of Remembrance
</p><p>     Jairnsaxa's duties and continued life.
</p><p>     Malwind's health"
</p><p>Speaking to Kothos, Missoni says, "I'm deep."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Global Storyline for 2024 - While I realize that the Global Storyline department is not centered out of Solhaven, I did figure I'd make a mention of it here since I am the one who is in charge of that.  This year's Global Storyline is the Chronicles of Norallen.  It started at the Kindred Games Festival and will continue once a month going forward.  The goal is to introduce the players to one-time locations and areas that will help paint a better picture of the world at large."
</p><p>Speaking to Marstreforn, Raelee says, "The fluffy abyss of hugs sounds terrifying to me."
</p><p>Guarrin says, "Oh fun."
</p><p>Phanna asks, "Oh, nice.  Kind of like with the Sayilla weekend event for new places?"
</p><p>Kothos says, "That does sound fun.  And it's great to see the Kindred getting some love."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "The planned method, though there may be changes to this as we develop, is to have the following:
</p><p>     Even-numbered Month
</p><p>     Vignette introducing the month's theme"
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "2-3 RP interactions in a specified area
</p><p>     Vignette closing the month's theme
</p><p>     Introduction of a new "lore" snippet regarding a "race-specific relic."
</p><p>     Odd-numbered Month
</p><p>     Vignette introducing the month's theme
</p><p>     NPC invitation to players to join the theme area for a weekend of "light" RP
</p><p>     Vignette closing the month's theme"
</p><p>Jisandra says, "We all love us some kindred."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "The Chronicles Wiki Page and Discord Forum will be updated as we go"
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Next Goal in the Storyline: Visit the Northern Fastness of the Wsalmir Clan"
</p><p>Phanna says, "That sounds like a lot of fun.  And ooh..."
</p><p>Ordim asks, "Relics eh?"
</p><p>Ordim says, "Time to dust off the old relic hunter title."
</p><p>Speaking to Ordim, Perigourd says, "Yunnag's lightning case. Belt of forging."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "The Clockwerke Devices Theme of the Year
</p><p>     Will Solhaven see something for this theme? The short answer is yes.
</p><p>     The Year of the Rolton Theme
</p><p>     Solhaven didn't see much of an update in this area, what can we expect?
</p><p>     Petting Zoo will return, this will allow you to milk various animals in the petting zoo."
</p><p>Speaking to Ordim, Perigourd says, "Fun sounding things."
</p><p>Avrey asks, "Return permanently?"
</p><p>Phanna says, "Vanah's camel."
</p><p>Ordim says, "Ohhh boy."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Wow."
</p><p>Kothos says, "Excellent."
</p><p>Ordim exclaims, "The milking zoo!"
</p><p>Missoni says, "Call the milk maid's union."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Camel milk."
</p><p>Kothos asks, "...maids have a union?"
</p><p>Yukito exclaims, "More milk!"
</p><p>Speaking to Akenna, Ordim says, "We were 100% promised camel milk."
</p><p>Meliyara says, "Milk a cat."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Okay... final stretch..."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I hope Pasha's keeps her milk. Non dairy milk is nice."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Stretch Goal for Solhaven
</p><p>     It really struck a discordant note with me during the various storylines that criticism was leveled at Vornavis for having "fallowed" fields.  The short answer to this is, yes, you are correct, the fields of Vornavis have been fallow for a long time.  Why?  While I realize this is a low-level hunting ground for daggerbeaks, it doesn't mean that we can't accomplish two things at once here.  So, my stretch goal for Solhaven   and I've no idea if I can accomplish it this year   will be to create a barn, clean up the fields, and have some seasonally changed room descriptions and activities for this area."
</p><p>Speaking to Yukito, Akenna says, "Hadya loves her goat's milk."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Non dairy milk also works in the ice cream machines."
</p><p>Jisandra says, "Oooo."
</p><p>Avrey says, "I'm excited to hear this."
</p><p>Phanna says, "That sounds really neat."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Akenna says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Ifanna says, "Ooo farming."
</p><p>Ifanna says, "Farmquest."
</p><p>Ordim says, "The landing has Silver Gate, Solhaven might have THE BARN."
</p><p>Kothos says, "...it sounds really weird to be excited over milking animals, but here we are."
</p><p>Speaking to Ifanna, Avrey jests, "Farmstone."
</p><p>Akenna says, "It's really neat to see all these things."
</p><p>Yukito exclaims, "We can have barn dances, or weddings!"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Farmland Saga."
</p><p>Missoni says, "One step closer to being stardew valley...."
</p><p>Speaking to Yukito, Meliyara exclaims, "This here's a hootenany!"
</p><p>Speaking to Missoni, Perigourd says, "We have the tools."
</p><p>Speaking to Bristenn, Kothos says, "The Pastoral Bahs."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "No."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I've had to calm myself a bit, this is all so exciting."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Okay, with all that in mind, via hand, let's have folks raise their hands that have questions and I'll get to answering some questions."
</p><p>Asheura says, "We could have an actual barnraising, heh."
</p><p>Jiarine says, "Someone can teach square dancing."
</p><p>Speaking to Jiarine, Yukito exclaims, "SQUARE DANCING!"
</p><p>Jisandra says, "Why do only the warriors and rogues get to dance..."
</p><p>Phanna says, "You already answered all of mine.  I've enjoyed this past year quite a bit and am looking forward to what this new one has laid out for it."
</p><p>Speaking to Yukito, Kippe says, "Semis and pures should be able to dance, also."
</p><p>You ask, "Avrey?"
</p><p>Speaking to Kippe, Yukito exclaims, "Oh, boo. Puns!"
</p><p>Speaking to Yukito, Kippe says, "She made me do it."
</p><p>Avrey recites:
</p><p>    "First, thank you for all of this!  Second, can we get something on the whiteboard about a cobbling place for Solhaven.  Third, you mentioned petting zoo coming back, is that permanently."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I can hardly think of what to ask. I'm good."
</p><p>Speaking to Yukito, Kothos says, "I know just how you feel."
</p><p>You say, "Yes, the petting zoo would be a permanent return."
</p><p>Akenna says, "I second a cobbling warehouse."
</p><p>Meliyara says, "Thirded."
</p><p>Delindra says, "Fourthethed."
</p><p>You say, "I can look into a cobbling warehouse, but with the list of goals for this year, it would like be a 2024 thing."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Fair enough."
</p><p>Avrey asks, "2025?"
</p><p>Craeguile says, "2025 ye mean."
</p><p>Guarrin says, "That works out."
</p><p>Guarrin says, "No no, too late, she said 2024."
</p><p>Kothos says, "I am happy and content, thrilled at what's already happened and what's to come."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Cobbling warehouse would be nice. We have a Cobbler on our map, but it sells shoes."
</p><p>You say, "Yes, I meant 2025."
</p><p>Missoni asks, "Maybe some of the new carts could have local materials on them? like oiremere and stuff?"
</p><p>Avrey exclaims, "She's locked into that now!"
</p><p>Ordim says, "Get cobbled in a south haven warehouse."
</p><p>Jisandra says, "Vornavian silk shoooeeessss."
</p><p>Speaking to Ordim, Meliyara asks, "Cobbler?"
</p><p>Avrey asks, "Maybe we can have these markets selling cobbling goods?"
</p><p>Alosaka says, "This all sounds interesting. I'm very excited."
</p><p>Avrey says, "That was all I had that was pressing."
</p><p>Yukito says, "It would be nicer to just have a cobbling workshop, instead of relying on the stalls."
</p><p>You say, "I can add the cobbling request for the Farmer's Market."
</p><p>You ask, "Alastir?"
</p><p>Alastir recites:
</p><p>    "Hi, long time listener, first time caller.  Can you help me understand why the bank is anti-magic/no-casting-allowed?  I think the Adventurer's Guild is the same."
</p><p>Raelee says, "And the library..."
</p><p>Yukito says, "And communitea.."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "The world loves warriors."
</p><p>You say, "The short answer?  Someone built it that way."
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Kothos says, "Loves them not to fill or light their tea kettles, I guess."
</p><p>Alastir asks, "I've bugged the rooms, is this something that can be re-evaluated?"
</p><p>You say, "However, I can look into those areas and get them adjusted.  I think all banks might be nomagic."
</p><p>Missoni says, "Communitea is especially rough cause you can't minor water your tea kettle."
</p><p>You ask, "When did you bug the rooms?"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "AdG Hall is probably for spam reduction, bank is probably abuse and spam reduction."
</p><p>Alastir says, "I'd have to check, it's been a minute."
</p><p>Alastir says, "But not all banks are no-magic."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I craft in the garden of Communitea a lot and the spell block is a bit annoying."
</p><p>Speaking to Missoni, Kothos says, "Carrying around your own stove is rather tough, too."
</p><p>Avrey says, "They don't want anyone setting the bank on fire."
</p><p>Kothos asks, "Don't the stoves know that my encumberance potions already have enough work to do?"
</p><p>Speaking to Avrey, Raelee says, "It was just that one time."
</p><p>Alastir says, "As a Bard, a no-magic room means I lose 7 spells at once."
</p><p>Speaking to Raelee, Perigourd asks, "Really?"
</p><p>Speaking to Kothos, Yukito says, "I've given up, and now I just buy encumberance potions for the year."
</p><p>You say, "I will look into those."
</p><p>Alastir says, "Thank you."
</p><p>You say, "Just to make sure I have the list correct."
</p><p>Speaking to Yukito, Jisandra mouths, "Me too."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Bank, Adv. Guild, Communitea, and Library?"
</p><p>Yukito says, "Thank you."
</p><p>Avrey says, "And I think the lockers dont allow disks."
</p><p>Berean quietly asks, "So more about the Wizard guild. Will this guild also have new skills for Wizards to learn?"
</p><p>Jisandra says, "Thank you. AdGuild would be so nice to be able to spell-up while we're distributing bounty tasks and such."
</p><p>You ask, "Bristenn?"
</p><p>Berean quietly says, "'I should have raised my hand. Sorry if I jumped in on someone elses question being answered. I had to step out for a moment."
</p><p>Speaking to Berean, you say, "There will not be new skills."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Two-fold here.  First, any thoughts on expansions for the Voln outpost, even in just the realm of RP opportunities?  More rooms, more functionality, etc."
</p><p>You ask, "Do you mean the Lance?"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Yes."
</p><p>You say, "Nope, zero thought about changing, updating, or creating more RP in that area."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Okiedokie. Second, supernodes."
</p><p>You say, "The list I have is pretty expansive, but will make a note."
</p><p>Bristenn asks, "We have very few supernodes, and most are either camped by bots, covered in litter, or both.  If at all possible, could we see more in the town?"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "The area in the barbican is nice.  Vornavis Proper supernode would be fantastic."
</p><p>You say, "I can look into that."
</p><p>Speaking to Bristenn, Perigourd says, "I've been sitting the barbican at times."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Thank you.  North Market is ... nice, but it never made sense to hang out in a busy market square.  I'm talking actual community hangout areas where you'd want loitering."
</p><p>You say, "I think the clinic is a node...."
</p><p>You say, "I'll have to check."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "IS IT SUPER."
</p><p>Meril says, "Not yet, would be good though."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "IF EVERY NODE IS SUPER, NO NODE IS SUPER."
</p><p>Speaking ominously to Bristenn, Lachonus exclaims, "I'll be seeing you at the future Vornavis supernode!"
</p><p>Speaking to Bristenn, Avrey says, "It would be if you were there."
</p><p>You ask, "Why are you yelling at me?"
</p><p>Yukito asks, "A supernode in Vornavis would be nice. I think?"
</p><p>Speaking to Bristenn, Guarrin says, "You're super."
</p><p>Ordim says, "Supper nodes."
</p><p>Meril says, "Personally I feel the point of supernodes is to have very few of them so as to force people to be around each other..."
</p><p>Raelee says, "Maybe the node just hasn't been bitten by a radioactive spider yet."
</p><p>You ask, "Aren't some of the gardens?"
</p><p>Speaking to Ordim, Mynon exclaims, "NOT at babs'!"
</p><p>Missoni says, "Lots of the gardens are nodes, but not super."
</p><p>Phanna says, "Some of them are nodes, yes."
</p><p>Lachonus says, "There's a fairly accurate wiki list."
</p><p>Akenna says, "I would love to be forced to hang out in Vornavis proper."
</p><p>Speaking to Mynon, Ordim says, "Those are supper nose."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Just saying."
</p><p>You ask, "So you specifically are looking for super nodes?"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Supers."
</p><p>Lachonus says, "Gotta get that +2 exp gains."
</p><p>Avrey says, "If ever there was a place to be bitten by a radioactive spider, it'd be Babs'."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I rather feel like I don't hang in supernodes much. Not that they are not nice, but they are very busy spots."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "I mean, I've long on discord lobbied for Whole Town is Supernode."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "I personally am in the camp of every room in the town should be a node."
</p><p>Ordim says, "Put one in the tea room at the cafe after it is unmagiced."
</p><p>Ordim says, "Gather around the stove and kettle."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "But I'll take what I can get if I'm not standing around a bloody trashcan and a muffinsmith for the next twenty years."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "TWENTY YEARS OF SMELLING THOSE MUFFINS."
</p><p>Avrey says, "I'd love to have insides of all towns be supernodes, yes."
</p><p>Speaking to Bristenn, Perigourd says, "Owly is going to eat you sir."
</p><p>Speaking to Bristenn, Ordim says, "Wow huge slam on the baldes and belts stalls."
</p><p>Delindra says, "I mean."
</p><p>Alosaka says, "Could be a fun experiment. For one year, make every room in Solhaven a super node. This December, assess how it affected the game balance."
</p><p>You say, "Hey, I hear those muffins help fight vampires."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I like NM, but a node by the new fountain would be nice."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Perigourd exclaims, "He copped to the lie!"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Anywho, that's all I had."
</p><p>Missoni says, "Listen that trash can is very clean from lack of use."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Yes, because the bench is being used instead."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Isn't it just."
</p><p>You say, "There's only so many things I can get permission for, but I'll look into it."
</p><p>Meril unhelpfully suggests, "Trash cans are anachronistic."
</p><p>Craeguile says, "Vote against a plethora of supernodes, it's hard enough to be in the know where folks are congregating."
</p><p>You ask, "Missoni?"
</p><p>Missoni says, "My question was about cobbling."
</p><p>Missoni exclaims, "So it's been answered, thank you!"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Alastir says, "Just let them know you're the Captain now."
</p><p>You ask, "Perigourd?"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Ah, that's me."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "The first question was going to be about fishing, but you answered that and then some with far more than I hoped for, so thank you for that."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Kothos says, "I don't wish to interrupt, but I'm on my way out, and just wanted to thank you and the rest of the staff again.  You're all talented and appreciated."
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "The second question is in relation to the Vornavis proper expansion and if it would be possible to get a tournament field added to that with an archery range, jousting list, and melee ring?"
</p><p>You say, "That's a tall ask."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Take from Helden what is rightfully the Empire's."
</p><p>You say, "I'll see what I can do."
</p><p>Avrey asks, "Functioning?"
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Kippe says, "Go big or go home."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "I'd settle just for an open field to bludgeon eachother in."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Because I tried to get that damn fighting pit script in Sunholm to no avail."
</p><p>Bristenn exclaims, "Elysani remembers!"
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Meliyara asks, "Isnt that just wherever you happen to be?"
</p><p>Alastir says, "I think there's some fallowed land for that."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "True true."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Or casting at people in?  I don't bludgeon, I burn."
</p><p>Guarrin says, "Settle for opening up the feat at rallick's field instead."
</p><p>Speaking to Bristenn, Missoni says, "Injustice is what that is."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "We gotta use live steel."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "My final request is a habitual consideration for swan boats down the canal, for those midnight rendezvous."
</p><p>Ifanna says, "Ughgh the drill yard."
</p><p>Speaking to Akenna, Craeguile says, "Ooh, a spot to watch wizard duals. If we're puttin' up the guild, they can at least provide some entertainment."
</p><p>You ask, "Can't the boats go under the bridges and through the canal?"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "I don't believe so, no. And they're not shaped like swans."
</p><p>Ordim asks, "Isn't that a little too on the nose for a metaphor&gt;?"
</p><p>You say, "Oh, I see, you want me specifically to create swan boats."
</p><p>Jisandra says, "Think "The Little Mermaid" and "Kiss the Girl."."
</p><p>Guarrin asks, "Phrasing?"
</p><p>Speaking to Ordim, Meliyara asks, "What's a meta for?"
</p><p>Akenna exclaims, "A wizard training yard! That's an idea!"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Perigourd says, "This is vornavis after all."
</p><p>You ask, "Like as a kind of amusement ride?"
</p><p>Speaking to Meliyara, Ordim says, "Two pounds."
</p><p>Alastir says, "As you go under the bridge, you see a bright flash of light and a heart-shaped postcard falls from above."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Perigourd says, "Indeed."
</p><p>Speaking to Akenna, Jaysehn says, "Maybe a room at the new guild."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Tunnel of love."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Or canal, if you prefer."
</p><p>Jisandra says, "Singing crab."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "That's all I had."
</p><p>Alastir says, "You see Perigourd and Missoni k-i-s-s-i-n-g."
</p><p>Speaking to Jaysehn, Akenna says, "Haha maybe.  Akenna would hang out there."
</p><p>Jisandra says, "Sha-la-la-la-la-la my oh my."
</p><p>You say, "Itneresting."
</p><p>Lylia says, "There was a Tunnel of Love ride at the old Festival of Oleani. I mean the ooooold festival."
</p><p>Avrey says, "Very cool idea."
</p><p>Casil says, "Just remember boats are NOT private."
</p><p>Missoni exclaims, "You wouldn't see it if we were in our own private swan boat!"
</p><p>Yukito says, "Make the canal between Vornavis and Solhaven. Along that wall? On the Vornavis side. That could be pretty."
</p><p>Casil says, "Please."
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, Guarrin says, "Wow, I remember that festival."
</p><p>Missoni says, "Sure they're not if you creep on us."
</p><p>Jisandra says, "Oh DEAR."
</p><p>Speaking to Guarrin, Lylia says, "By the transitive property, you are now old."
</p><p>Cryheart says, "Consider them carts throughto Zul."
</p><p>Casil says, "I do no creeping."
</p><p>Akenna asks, "Are boats even stable enough for that?"
</p><p>Phanna says, "I vaguely remember something like that at EG maybe 20 years ago, too.  Maybe longer."
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, Raelee exclaims, "We're not old until we're 44!"
</p><p>Cryheart says, "But centered here."
</p><p>Lylia says, "EG had the carriage rides."
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, Guarrin says, "Eesh tell me about it."
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, Raelee says, "Then we're REAL old."
</p><p>Speaking to Akenna, Craeguile says, "Takes a bit of balance...."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Boats are stable enough for a lot of things."
</p><p>Casil says, "Like fishing."
</p><p>You ask, "Wait, you are old at 44?"
</p><p>Avrey says, "There's currently the boats for Naidem, tooo."
</p><p>Phanna says, "There was definitely a boat ride at EG before Velathae."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Per the Age List thing, yes."
</p><p>Casil says, "Sweet. I am not old yet."
</p><p>Speaking to Akenna, Kippe speculates, "With practice, maybe."
</p><p>Meliyara says, "According to human aging in game."
</p><p>Avrey asks, "Only 44?"
</p><p>Guarrin says, "I'm not even that old."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Craeguile says, "Certainly not young..."
</p><p>Raelee exclaims, "Yes.  Have you seen what the age descriptions for humans at 44+ are?!"
</p><p>Yukito says, "That age list needs to be burned."
</p><p>Speaking to Raelee, Perigourd says, "Lived them."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "At 44, you go from 'in your prime' to 'u ded'."
</p><p>You ask, "I hit 50 this year.... I guess that's one foot in the grave?"
</p><p>Casil says, "Oh right. I forgot that. We should have someone fix that."
</p><p>Mynon asks, "Incorrect, you mean?"
</p><p>Akenna says, "Yeah at 44 you're practically an old krone."
</p><p>Alosaka says, "Withered, decrepit, archeological, historically significant..."
</p><p>Casil says, "1...2...3..not it."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Raelee says, "If you're a human in Elanthia, yes."
</p><p>Guarrin says, "According to age descriptions for humans, yes."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Crone."
</p><p>Avrey exclaims, "Long in the tooth!"
</p><p>Missoni says, "Age list clearly written by elves."
</p><p>Meliyara exclaims, "What's that? Casil volunteered?!"
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Raelee says, "You have two years left."
</p><p>You say, "Oh, this is the age description discussion."
</p><p>You say, "Got it."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "City-states propaganda."
</p><p>You say, "I was confused."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Uhg sorry, I'm riding high on post surgery and current pain relievers."
</p><p>Speaking to Raelee, Casil exclaims, "MOre than that!"
</p><p>Akenna says, "My spelling is horrible."
</p><p>You say, "Moving along..."
</p><p>Craeguile says, "We got distracted from smoochy swan boats and are now off-track."
</p><p>You ask, "Raelee?"
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Raelee says, "Two years is when *I* need it, thus that's the deadline."
</p><p>Avrey says, "Mmm cookies."
</p><p>Casil says, "Oh."
</p><p>Raelee says, "I'm gonna be that one who asks 3 questions at once.  Sorry."
</p><p>Jisandra mutters, "Those guys need to stop it with the cookies, they always kick off the munchies."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Raelee asks, "When we say the new Wizard Guild is a satellite of the Hall... are we viewing this on the same level of the colleges in Tamzyrr, Nydds, Elstreth, Swale, etc... or is it a smaller Hall establishment?"
</p><p>Casil says, "Oh, I have cookies."
</p><p>Speaking to Jisandra, Kippe says, "Solution.  Always have cookies nearby."
</p><p>You say, "It will be a smaller establishment."
</p><p>Speaking to Kippe, Jisandra says, "I did but then I ate them."
</p><p>Raelee says, "Excellent."
</p><p>Speaking to Raelee, Alosaka says, "No supervision, still."
</p><p>Raelee says, "I think smaller ones are sometimes easier to make feel right, if that makes sense."
</p><p>Yukito says, "That's gonna be so awesome."
</p><p>You say, "Well, wait..."
</p><p>Craeguile exclaims, "Got the milk!"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Raelee says, "And I guess I have a hope for storylines.  I'm really excited about what you've laid out, but the one thing I'd like to see is some emphasis on common goals and community building.  I think 2022 and 2023 have been really full of stories that were about conflict between groups of people, and it would be nice to take some of those groups and bring them back together."
</p><p>Raelee says, "That wasn't really a question but... yeah."
</p><p>You say, "Smaller in comparison to Nydds, but still relatively large."
</p><p>Phanna says, "I wholeheartedly second that statement."
</p><p>Lylia exclaims, "Oh, yes, please!"
</p><p>Oishian exclaims, "Agreed!"
</p><p>You say, "That is the goal for the 2024 storylines."
</p><p>Ifanna exclaims, "Yes please!"
</p><p>Lylia says, "I like liking things. Please let me like things. And people. And things."
</p><p>Avrey says, "Amen to this, 150%."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Yes please very much."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Hallelujah."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Raelee says, "I'm very pleased to hear that."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Absolutely."
</p><p>Raelee says, "And my last question..."
</p><p>Casil says, "I'll plug TV here. Please come bond with our forest homies with us."
</p><p>Avrey says, "Lets stop pitting us against one another, lord knows we can do enough of that on our own."
</p><p>Akenna exclaims, "I do!"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Raelee says, "Ultimately, everything sounds so great.  I really love that all of these new updates have really made this town feel *lived in".  Thus, all I have left is low-stakes requests: amongst the expansions in Vornavis... can we have a bench?  Some place to sit would be nice."
</p><p>Akenna says, "It's great."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Perigourd says, "We have our own forest homies."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Come to TV."
</p><p>Speaking to Ordim, Casil says, "You're still not allowed in the borders."
</p><p>Missoni says, "Love me some TV."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Raelee says, "I'll settle for a plank of wood on some cinderblocks.  Doesn't need to be fancy and padded or anything."
</p><p>You say, "You can sit on the fountain..."
</p><p>Raelee asks, "Can you?"
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Ordim says, "Good."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Alastir says, "Solhaven seems more welcoming, at least the regulars of the city."
</p><p>You ask, "Or maybe its lean?"
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Kippe says, "They're called bandits."
</p><p>Asheura says, "But then Raelee might get wet."
</p><p>Raelee says, "A fountain is a lot fancier than a plank of wood..."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Oh! Didn't know that! I usually sit on the floor when I hang there."
</p><p>You say, "The fountain has a bunch of script."
</p><p>Speaking to Kippe, Perigourd says, "And they're always trying to share their affection."
</p><p>Speaking to Asheura, Raelee says, "Valid point.  Water is Raelee's least favorite element."
</p><p>Speaking to Raelee, Perigourd says, "Oooo."
</p><p>Lylia says, "Although on behalf of Raelee, please make any seating the "for a moment's rest" messaging and not the "fling yourself on the seat" messaging."
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Kippe says, "Especially Cryheart."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Same."
</p><p>Speaking to Asheura, Raelee says, "She might melt, like the Wicked Witch of the west."
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, Raelee says, "Hear hear."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Ordim says, "We shall see."
</p><p>You say, "The plan for the new neighborhood does have a bench in it."
</p><p>Speaking to Raelee, Asheura says, "I know i've seen steam come from her ears occasionally, so that completely stands to reason."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Benches and supernodes."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Wd do love benches."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Raelee says, "And lastly, just thank you.  Everything in the past year has been... so great."
</p><p>Akenna says, "And trash barrels."
</p><p>Akenna says, "Please, trash barrels."
</p><p>Ordim says, "And muffinsmith stalls."
</p><p>Yukito says, "A bench is pretty much... a marker for gathering. And trash barrels, yes."
</p><p>You say, "I'm pleased you all have enjoyed it."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "The last year of Solhaven has been nothing but strength to strength."
</p><p>Delindra says, "Oh god he's here for our deeds."
</p><p>Meliyara exclaims, "Hide your deeds!"
</p><p>Speaking to Kenstrom, Lylia exclaims, "Oh hi there!"
</p><p>Asheura says, "Ditto, the past year has been a blast."
</p><p>You ask, "Yukito?"
</p><p>Phanna says, "Yes, I've really enjoyed the past year."
</p><p>Speaking to Kenstrom, Kippe says, "Mine."
</p><p>Delindra says, "Over my dead bod....!! wait."
</p><p>Avrey says, "And for the love of all that's holy, make them barrels so I don't type, put blah in barr...::rassin frassin::  put blah in waste."
</p><p>Ordim says, "It was a good year."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Something not fun is happening at Silverwood because the fun is here."
</p><p>Yukito recites:
</p><p>    "Thank you very much for all you have done for us. It is appreciated, and the town feels very lively."
</p><p>Akenna says, "I don't mind if it is a pretty trash barrel."
</p><p>Akenna says, "I like those."
</p><p>Yukito says, "My question is, for the new Clinic in South Haven, can we get a storage bin, please? My personal vote, also, is to remove the chalkboard and just keep the message board. I hate to bring in a rsour note, but already, we cannot post positive messages there without it being overwritten, so it's more of a bother than fun to interact with."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I mean storage as in herbs."
</p><p>Avrey says, "An herb crate for us to stock is a fantastic idea."
</p><p>Yukito exclaims, "Wow... did everyone die? Did my internet drop.. there we go!"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Chalkboard capable of multiple messages might be okay, too.  I think the one there has space for only one."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I always freak out when I feel as if I totally brought convo to a stop."
</p><p>You say, "Short answer is yes, I can get a storage bin.  As for the chalkboard, I've already got on my list to talk to the owner to see if any that are permanently added to places can have an update."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Thank you. That's all i had."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Raelee mentions, "The chalkboards in the Imperial Outpost have a different script that allows multiple messages."
</p><p>Meril says, "I think chalkboards just need line breaks, something like that."
</p><p>Missoni says, "Yeah, the CHE ones do too i think."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Right, so does the chalkboard in our MHO structure."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Raelee says, "Kenstrom fled, else I'd point at him."
</p><p>You say, "Mostly, I want to have the ability for us to see who is posting on them, but I will look them up."
</p><p>Phanna says, "So many different chalkboard scripts."
</p><p>Lylia says, "Public chalkboards are hellish to maintain. Ask me how I know."
</p><p>Avrey asks, "Maybe a message board would be better for that location?"
</p><p>Cryheart asks, "Ok..how do ye know?"
</p><p>Speaking to Avrey, Raelee says, "It has both currently."
</p><p>You ask, "Quarrin?"
</p><p>You say, "Er."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "He's Quarrin now."
</p><p>Speaking to Cryheart, Lylia says, "The old one in the Landing was awash with horrors."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Nope, locked in."
</p><p>You say, "Guarrin."
</p><p>Guarrin says, "Finally the name change I've always wanted."
</p><p>You say, "Sorry, that was a pretty good typo."
</p><p>Missoni says, "Now i won't ask him for bounties anymore."
</p><p>Guarrin asks, "First off, thank you for the wonderful year and the fantastic outlook for next year. I have a few comments though. Earlier you mentioned that the goal for storylines was to have less conflict, does that cover all storylines? Just those within solhaven?"
</p><p>You say, "I believe there is a discussion to produce more community building globally.  You see it already in IMT, TV, and KF."
</p><p>Casil says, "Even if TV and TI are having a minor tiff at the moment."
</p><p>Casil says, "It's between leadership only, not citizens."
</p><p>Elysani says, "Very minor, nothing to see there."
</p><p>Craeguile says, "I think tiff's are how they build community."
</p><p>You say, "I can't speak for the road on the current WL storyline as that would provide spoilers for that storyline and I don't really want to do that or speak for that area."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Guarrin says, "Alright. I've got a second question as well."
</p><p>You say, "He'll be running his own OOCmeeting soon."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Guarrin says, "'Second, I'm glad Kenstrom is back because I am curious about the approach to aligning imperials between you both given the vast difference in how they are depicted depending on which town you are in."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I'm interested, too."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Alastir exclaims, "I don't know how to glance at you skeptically, but if I did, I would!"
</p><p>Avrey says, "Three."
</p><p>Speaking to Alastir, Casil says, "Glance skeptical casil."
</p><p>You say, "Kenstrom, Auchand, and I bounce around the Human Empire stuff all the time.  However, we should probably schedule a Human Empire meeting to ensure we are gathering enough thoughts from all that have interests in them."
</p><p>Yukito says, "We're not really playing frontier. It would be nice to have a nice focus on the Empire and it's culture and lore."
</p><p>Ifanna exclaims, "Yes please!"
</p><p>Yukito exclaims, "That wasn't in response to Thandiwe!"
</p><p>Alastir says, "I like that things seem to be more group-oriented now."
</p><p>Raelee says, "I'd really look forward to a meeting like that."
</p><p>Phanna says, "I would look forward to that meeting, too."
</p><p>Missoni whispers aloud, "Can i come?"
</p><p>Lylia says, "Count me in, please."
</p><p>You say, "There is of course always going to be a different in how those areas look, though."
</p><p>Speaking to Missoni, Perigourd jests, "Humans only."
</p><p>You say, "As Yukito pointed out..."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Yes, I would look forward to pushing more evil empire agenda."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Guarrin says, "That sounds great. Thank you all again for all the great work this year. I'm very much looking forward to next year."
</p><p>You say, "Solhaven/Vornavis IS in the Empire."
</p><p>Yukito exclaims, "It IS!"
</p><p>You say, "Wehnimer's is not."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Go home empire sulhjavin is freeport and freeport is FREE."
</p><p>Alosaka says, "Say =whisper yet."
</p><p>Speaking to Alosaka, Perigourd says, "I was about to."
</p><p>Speaking to Alosaka, Kippe agrees, "Yet."
</p><p>You say, "Yes, but you know what I mean, Bristenn."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Guarrin says, "Well...I mean. Protectorate."
</p><p>Alastir says, "Why do I hear the Darth Vader theme playing."
</p><p>Cryheart says, "Wehnimer has been designated as a procterate."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Huehue."
</p><p>You say, "That isn't what I meant."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "I'm being glib but not using glib tones."
</p><p>Cryheart says, "Errr...protectorate."
</p><p>You say, "What I mean is that within the empire, we are going to see different things."
</p><p>You say, "And the Malwinds (on a whole) are the good guys."
</p><p>Ordim says, "They even have a smoking crater."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "I would say the Caulfields are also in the good camp."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "From what I've seen."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Give us a chance to kick another Jantalar in the butt."
</p><p>Lylia says, "Which is like a smoking jacket, only much, much roomier."
</p><p>You say, "Yes, but we don't really get to "play" there."
</p><p>You say, "I just meant in the accessible world."
</p><p>Mynon says, "I sure hope they are."
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, Raelee says, "I'm working on expanding it."
</p><p>Lylia says, "Xorus would like to subscribe to your newsletter."
</p><p>You ask, "I may have missed a hand, did anyone else have a question?"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "I for one would vote against more imperial civil war stuff.  We've had like six."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Guarrin asks, "Sorry, is the intent there that we see the 'good' here and just won't elsewhere?"
</p><p>You say, "So, this is where I'm going to get put into a corner to make a commitment for another area."
</p><p>Yukito asks, "We do sorta have that "OBEY THE EMPEROR" vibe, but in a cheery way. Stormtroopers with fashion sense?"
</p><p>Ordim sincerely says, "Thanks for all the hard work from everyone the past year! its way past bread time."
</p><p>Guarrin says, "'::thandiwe Not the intent, just looking for an answer."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "We can have ten pieces of flair instead of five."
</p><p>You say, "I'm not saying that you are going to see bad stuff elsewhere, I'm saying that I'm trying to provide a positive light in this area that is in the empire."
</p><p>Guarrin says, "Gotcha, thank you for clarifying."
</p><p>Meril says, "The world as described in the lore has so many hostile things in it, and that forces people to band together. Adventurers have become a bit complacent, no one is really afraid of orcs or trolls or giants anymore so Landing vs. Empire, or Icemule vs. Vaalor somehow become a thing."
</p><p>You say, "And for the record, I actually get ridiculed for that, too."
</p><p>Yukito says, "We don't want that, Thandiwe. Believe us. I think the overall vibe is, we'd like our own stories and not stories that are extentions of Landing that effect us. We are really meeting that goal lately, and we want to offer support."
</p><p>Lylia says, "By whom? Geez, that seems harsh."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Usually me, but mostly others."
</p><p>You say, "I've been accused of whitewashing the game a few times."
</p><p>Meliyara says, "I'd love to see more external threats, so that those town vs. town, PC vs. PC faction things become less of a thing."
</p><p>You say, "Which isn't my goal."
</p><p>You say, "But I do want to provide spaces where people don't have to deal with conflict."
</p><p>Speaking to Meliyara, Perigourd says, "I was hoping Finnia was about that."
</p><p>You say, "Or let me rephrase."
</p><p>Lylia suggests, "Behizet, Jewel of the Wastes!"
</p><p>Geijon says, "Morvule is out there."
</p><p>You say, "Where there isn't internal-player v. player conflict."
</p><p>Geijon says, "Maybe the sands has a really big powerful mummy."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Morvule is always out there.  Don't believe the Everwatch propaganda that he's gone."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Whitewashing in what way, and to whom? The Solhaven folk here seem to really want what you've got going for us."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "The white fire of Koarites can never defeat my true love."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Er, greatest foe.  Yes."
</p><p>Speaking dryly to Yukito, Alosaka says, "Downplaying the settler-colonial nature of Empires."
</p><p>Speaking to Yukito, you say, "It doesn't matter."
</p><p>Geijon says, "I knew right when I said it it was going there."
</p><p>Speaking to Alosaka, Yukito says, "Ah. Well. That is frontier town stuff. We are established empire. We need our own stories that WE want."
</p><p>Casil says, "There's always people with differing opinions than the majority."
</p><p>Lylia says, "I get that conflict drives story, and story is what we collectively do. But I appreciate it when the nature of that conflict varies -- when it's us against a 'big bad,' or us against the environment a la exploration or discovery."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Sorry, that might have seemed pointed. I should have written two sentences."
</p><p>Speaking to Alosaka, Meliyara protests, "We're an anarco-syndicalist commune! Help, help! I'm being repressed!"
</p><p>Casil says, "It's very hard to satisfy everyone, which is why a variety of stories is best."
</p><p>You ask, "Lachonus, you had a question?"
</p><p>Lachonus asks, "First of all, amazing work!  My question was around the lingering items from the 2022 list on town ambient messaging. I d love to see more of this, especially near the ocean areas so that it feels that much more like a coastal vibe in those areas of town. Is that something we could perhaps squeeze some writing contests in around, if that would help lighten the writing load a bit and move it onto the 2024 list of wonder somehow?"
</p><p>You ask, "Do you mean the trading stuff I mentioned for the 2024 list?"
</p><p>You ask, "About the boats unloading and moving items north?"
</p><p>Bristenn exclaims, "Fishpeople ambients!"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "..well, fishermen and fishwives."
</p><p>Speaking to Bristenn, Raelee accuses, "You're a fishpeople."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Fishpeople live in the bog and they are slimey."
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "Do shan ever peaceably come to town to shop?"
</p><p>Missoni says, "Oooh merfolk."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "I am."
</p><p>You say, "Yes, I need to create a ton of fishwives yell in Marshtown."
</p><p>Lachonus says, "Maybe I didn't understand that as ambient messaging earlier."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "A chorus of fishwives."
</p><p>Kippe says, "There used to be an ambient message at the bench by the dock about being covered in mist from the waves.  It disappeared several years ago.  I loved it."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "We'll call it the Seven Shrieks of Fishination."
</p><p>Meliyara says, "The fishination shall become..."
</p><p>You say, "I can look into that Kippe, let me write that down."
</p><p>Lachonus says, "Yeah, ocean themes. Sounds, sea birds, commerce, and so forth."
</p><p>You say, "I remember that messaging."
</p><p>Lachonus says, "Fog..."
</p><p>Speaking to Meliyara, Asheura exclaims, "The fish nation?  Shelfae invasion!"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Gulls that snatch corndogs from you on the boardwalk."
</p><p>Guarrin asks, "Shan market expansion?"
</p><p>You ask, "Jaysehn?"
</p><p>Speaking to Bristenn, Raelee says, "We have owls for that."
</p><p>Lachonus says, "Muffins, rather."
</p><p>Cryheart says, "Ambience gives it a living sense of an environment."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "I have two quick ones."
</p><p>Speaking to Jaysehn, Casil says, "No Voln can't become emperor."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "You don't want him as emperor."
</p><p>Yukito asks, "A not so serious inquiry. Seasilk! It's supposed to be an export. What is it made of? Is it from mollousks?"
</p><p>Casil says, "Second question."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Sorry, I was trying to queue that up and hit enter."
</p><p>Jaysehn asks, "First, can I recommend that GMs do a session zero about their towns?"
</p><p>Speaking flatly to Kenstrom, Lachonus says, "No."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Not just a meeting like this ,which I adored and thank you for."
</p><p>You say, "That is what OOC Meetingds are."
</p><p>Speaking to Yukito, Alastir says, "We'll tell you about that when you're a little older."
</p><p>Speaking to Jaysehn, Perigourd asks, "You mean in relation to storylines?"
</p><p>Speaking to Yukito, Asheura whispers aloud, "Yes, seasilk is an IRL fabric made from mollusc... secretions."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "But...tell us what the lines are. Themes. What is going to be seen alot, what themes are not going to happen etc."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Just so expectations are there for storylines."
</p><p>Yukito says, "To be honest? I'm just happy we all got the chance to talk like this. And happy to be able to chat with the GMs, too."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "My second one is simple."
</p><p>Casil says, "Avery didnt even want me here."
</p><p>Casil says, "Avrey even."
</p><p>Delindra says, "I mean."
</p><p>Avrey says, "With the new stuff regarding Wyrdeep and its emancipation, how will that effect the borders that are currently mapped out?  I ask because I placed Avrey's village squished just bordering Wyrdeep and Dragach, and now I have no idea where she'd actually say she's from.  For reference, I'm looking at https://gswiki.play.net/images/gswiki/9/92/Tura_map.jpg in particular."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Guarrin exclaims, "But I did!"
</p><p>Avrey says, "Ack."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "I'd just like to request, as I did last year, that we not cast players, or the IC institutions they are aligned with, in the role of villains for other players to use as unwilling foils.I'm asking this of the staff in general. And thank you."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Avrey scolds, "You made me think I was being called on!"
</p><p>You say, "Session Zeros are very complicated for a live game environment.  When you have 6-8 people at a DnD table, you can do that easily because you only have to taper the expectations of 6-8 people, we can have upwards of 50-100 people at our storylines.  It is unreasonable to do that and balance all those people.  However, how do you handle new people entering storylines?  There will be a bias if they weren't allowed to be at session zero for whatever reason and we don't want to exclude people.  I thihnk we come a long way with updating the wiki to have a broad scope of information."
</p><p>Speaking to Avrey, Perigourd says, "I'd guess that the forest line itself was the border, and anything outside of it remains imperial."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Like... I'm willing to be a villian, it's just so much emotional work and prep. Not saying we can't have tension, but it really sends some of us into a fret."
</p><p>Casil says, "If I may interject, too, the complication is that it's also not always easy to know exactly what themes are going to be present and what aren't."
</p><p>You say, "There also ends up this issue where if the players do or trigger something that changes the storyline, modifies, it now we've had a session zero that has to be altered."
</p><p>Casil says, "What players do can and has changed the course--"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Casil says, "Ok jinx."
</p><p>Geijon says, "I missed my chance that one time I got sympathized so far."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I did like it when Quillic did session zeros."
</p><p>Yukito says, "The difference is, that the people who are in orders here move as one unit, I think. There isn't a lot of rugged individualism in the Empire."
</p><p>Yukito exclaims, "And... we don't seem to want it!"
</p><p>Yukito says, "Hush, you."
</p><p>You ask, "Jaysehn, I tried to scroll up to see your secfond simple question but... didn't?"
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Oh... sorry."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "I'd just like to request, as I did last year, that we not cast players, or the IC institutions they are aligned with, in the role of villains for other players to use as unwilling foils.I'm asking this of the staff in general. And thank you."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "More of a request. no response needed."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Thank you."
</p><p>You say, "Ah.  Gotcha."
</p><p>Speaking to Meliyara, Yukito says, "I don't speak for everyone, but you too. Welcome again to the Order."
</p><p>Avrey says, "Seconded on that request."
</p><p>Lylia says, "I am a fan of opt-in villainy myself."
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, Raelee says, "I'm just waiting for my chance, really."
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, Craeguile asks, "Do they have a sheet we can sign up for?"
</p><p>Lylia says, "Saaaame."
</p><p>Delindra says, "I'm gonna be so villainous this year. Just wait."
</p><p>Cryheart says, "Oy."
</p><p>Delindra says, "I'm gonna... litter... so hard."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Than I'll see you on the battlefield."
</p><p>Speaking to Delindra, Meliyara asks, "An invasion of puns?"
</p><p>Craeguile exclaims, "Rogues and Villains welcome!"
</p><p>Casil asks, "Out of curiosity and totally not for any reason, who here DOES consider themselves villainous? Or at least willing to go into that realm?"
</p><p>Speaking to Delindra, Missoni exclaims, "Not on our street!"
</p><p>Speaking to Delindra, Guarrin says, "Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal."
</p><p>Yukito exclaims, "We don't litter in this town, Constable!"
</p><p>Speaking to Delindra, Avrey exclaims, "Throw that sh..stuff on the GROUND!"
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Raelee says, "I'd be careful with it, but I am willing to go there."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "I've been in the antagonist role before, but not as a villain."
</p><p>Phanna says, "I do, but not necessarily with this character."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Perigourd says, "That depends on the perspective of what the villain is."
</p><p>Speaking lightly to Phanna, Asheura says, "Same."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Perigourd says, "For instance.."
</p><p>Delindra says, "....sarcasm and jokes aside, I'm about as villainous as a marshmallow."
</p><p>Casil says, "Criminal activity for instance."
</p><p>Yukito says, "My character is neutral. Both good and evil."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "However, that would require a lot of elaboration on how I wound up in an antagonist role."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Perigourd asks, "What are the moral grounds?"
</p><p>Speaking to Delindra, Raelee asks, "Like... the Stay-Puffed Marshmallow?"
</p><p>Mynon says, "Might be willing to murder a certain NPC..."
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Casil says, "THere are none."
</p><p>Missoni says, "I do some illegal stuff but i'm very nice about it."
</p><p>Speaking to Delindra, Avrey asks, "Diabetics live in fear of your marshmallowy goodness?"
</p><p>You say, "Avrey, I'm confused by your question -- slightly -- if it is a Human Village on the border of Bourth/Wyrdeep and Dragach then that is rather an anomoly.  The Wyrdeep has always been listed as a hive for elves and other non-human groups.  I would say that you have a lot of role playing opportunities if this was a human village in that area and that you would be considered part of the Wyrdeep nation unless you the border village decided to vote to be Dragach."
</p><p>Perigourd asks, "Criminal just for the sake of being criminal?"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Perigourd wouldn't do that, probably."
</p><p>Speaking to Mynon, Kippe says, "All of them."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I also, when I am a villain, or being underhanded IG, have had a long and full convo with the other parties, rare as that happens."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "..which can be tl;dr as 'being an imperial knight,' and to be honest, it wasn't fun.  Every time I logged in, I was swarmed with locates, familiars, ACs, people fogging to me while I was doing escort bounties, etc."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Perigourd says, "But if you gave him a logical reason to follow the empire into battle agaisnt the elves, or frankly, anyone, it's likely."
</p><p>Speaking to Kippe, Mynon says, "I'm way more specific."
</p><p>Yukito exclaims, "Marshmallows!"
</p><p>Lylia says, "In the long, broad sweep of things, my character does seek to control...well, everything she can. Maybe 'antagonist' would be better than 'villain,' but I am definitely willing to go to dark places."
</p><p>Speaking to Mynon, Kippe suggests, "Too specific, maybe?"
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Perigourd says, "IF it was to pro-actively invade a demon valence and put them down before they spawn through, without warning, also possible."
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, Missoni says, "Same, if the reason is right."
</p><p>Speaking to Perigourd, Craeguile says, "Villain as in murderin folks in abandon, never. But with the right motivation, a fair number of us would bear a darker role, if available."
</p><p>Yukito says, "But... I think the question has been answered by the folk that are awake and aware at least in this room. We're mostly good aligned."
</p><p>You say, "I can't tell you how to roleplay these changes, I can just provide the backdrop for your decisions."
</p><p>Speaking to Kippe, Mynon says, "It's a him, with a surname of DeArchon."
</p><p>Lachonus says, "I sense a LOT of chaotic and lawful neutral in the crowd."
</p><p>Avrey says, "Ok, thank you."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "It just has to fit the internal motivations of the character."
</p><p>Speaking to Mynon, Kippe says, "We know who to look for."
</p><p>Delindra says, "Jisandra's a couple of events away from exploring a villain arc. Maybe."
</p><p>Lylia says, "Oh, I'M good-aligned. My character isn't, though. Wow, she's awful."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "And at times, it could be triggered by the emotional or mental state of that time."
</p><p>Cryheart says, "To be, or not to be."
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, Raelee offers, "Raelee likes her?"
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Guys, could we return focus to this meeting and maybe move this discussion to the Roleplaying folder?"
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, Avrey says, "But she dresses well, and that's what matters."
</p><p>Speaking to Delindra, Missoni says, "Wait wil we tell her about sheru in the landing."
</p><p>Lylia contritely says, "Sorry."
</p><p>You say, "We are going into depths far beyond what this meeting was intended to cover."
</p><p>Yukito softly says, "Yes, mamma Thandiwe."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "A shadowy abyss, perhaps."
</p><p>You ask, "Geijon?"
</p><p>Perigourd whispers, "We just like spending time with you!"
</p><p>Yukito exclaims, "Cute!"
</p><p>Geijon says, "Let me see if I can fit my three. I really like the flavor of activity and the different decision making or locational community hijinks. Thanks."
</p><p>Geijon says, "Traders row and a lot of merchant stalls were mentioned. I like that. Will there be some mini festivals with those crystals and expanded options? I'm fond of those."
</p><p>Geijon asks, "Imperial life segway similar to the liveliness of areas. Vornavis as a daily double. The expansion of Vornavis, loved Perigourds comment. More simple or can we get a district name then the double is when will we get to the main gate of Vornavis and is that the wider vision?"
</p><p>Geijon says, "More simple meaning a general idea for the areas intent."
</p><p>You say, "The idea with the Farmers market is to allow them to open once a month every month in their own locations.  So -- for example -- Week 1 would be Marshtown, Week 2 would be Vornavis, Week three-- etc.  It would be automated openings of those small areas.  We have limited the Free Festivals to specific times of the year -- so this year there are two -- because its a lot of work and we are spreading ourselves realy thin.  So, no you won't see a festival around those things.  Even the 7 days/nights of Illumiation wasn't an official festival."
</p><p>Oishian says, "Way cooler than most festivals."
</p><p>Avrey asks, "So these are player organized farmers markets?"
</p><p>Speaking to Avrey, Perigourd says, "With automated extentsions, I believe."
</p><p>You say, "I'm not sure I understand your question about Vornavis."
</p><p>Meliyara says, "With some wares available from automated NPCs, from the sound of it."
</p><p>Yukito asks, "Are these markets like... stalls from around the Empire? Samples of their wares?"
</p><p>Avrey hopefully asks, "Like the holiday wagons?"
</p><p>You say, "There will be space for players to drop their market stalls.  But there will be a few carts that are NPC."
</p><p>Kippe says, "Backwards wave."
</p><p>You say, "I rather outlined it but I can repeat it if needed."
</p><p>Traiva says, "If you all will excuse me."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Marshtown Market - 3-4 stalls centered around items that the Marshfolk have to offer.  It will be a platform pier of 6-rooms that will allow players to place their stalls."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "The Tehir Traders - 3-4 stalls centered around offerings of the Shakat.  This will be located in the Vornavian Caravansary and be a crescent-shaped market."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Fisherman's Faire - 3-4 stalls centered around the offerings of both fisherman and fish wives.  This will be located in South Haven on Trader's Row.  Unlike the other areas, this will be a series of carts that appear during the open market (along with a billboard at the top of the street) that create the market."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "That's where I'll be."
</p><p>You recite:
</p><p>    "Vornavian Street Faire - 3-4 stalls centered around artwork and crafting.  These carts will be in the new Vornavis neighborhood.  During the 4-days of its opening, the guards will allow anyone to travel into the area."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Sorry, lost that in my notes. So we can just set up OUR stalls around those stalls."
</p><p>You say, "Yes."
</p><p>Avrey says, "Good lord, this sounds amazing."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Sounds fun."
</p><p>Geijon says, "Lot more detail. My mind got to wandering on new maps and just kind of the Solhaven area expanding in slight ways."
</p><p>Missoni says, "Especially excited about art faire."
</p><p>Geijon says, "And you presented a lot. Thank you."
</p><p>Yukito says, "You really knocked this meeting out of the park, yes. There is so much info."
</p><p>You say, "No worries, its a lot."
</p><p>Mynon says, "So instead of trying to track what's going on in the game, I get to just keep up on what's going on in my city, month to month. Good lord."
</p><p>You ask, "Yukito, you had a question about seasilk?"
</p><p>You say, "If that is what you wish."
</p><p>Yukito says, "I was trying to lighten the mood a bit, but yes! Mollousks. Vornavian mollousks. Can we get seasilk more documented someday in the future? No rush. We already have wonderful Vornavian oranges."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "And apples."
</p><p>Yukito asks, "Maybe the mollousks comr from Marshtown?"
</p><p>You say, "Likely the bay."
</p><p>You say, "But that borders Marshtown."
</p><p>Avrey says, "Maybe Babs has a secondary income."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "The Marshtown Mollousks are our local futbol team."
</p><p>You say, "Babs needs a bath."
</p><p>Yukito says, "It's not URGENT, and not important. Basically... it was a debate behind the scenes with characters."
</p><p>You say, "I can say that now that Ordim has left."
</p><p>You say, "Guarrin, you had a follow up question?  And then so did Bristenn."
</p><p>Guarrin says, "Oh no, I'm good."
</p><p>Guarrin exclaims, "Thank you though!"
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Meliyara, "Did I miss your hand?"
</p><p>You ask, "Bristenn?"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Arguably the most pressing question of the evening."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Shandits."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Say Shandits."
</p><p>Guarrin says, "Finally."
</p><p>You ask, "What?"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Perigourd says, "Tradition."
</p><p>Bristenn repeats, "Shandits."
</p><p>Avrey exclaims, "The pressing question of the night!"
</p><p>Meliyara whispers, "No, I was raising it in response to Casil's question."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "They're like bandits."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Only made of shan."
</p><p>Perigourd says, "But shan."
</p><p>You quietly whisper to Meliyara, "OAh."
</p><p>You say, "Oh, I see."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "You get shandits together."
</p><p>Casil says, "I'm leaving."
</p><p>Speaking to Delindra, Raelee exclaims, "Can I?!"
</p><p>Yukito exclaims, "Oh, you sweet summer GMS... playable shan!"
</p><p>Missoni says, "Oh."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Then you get us to either fight them, or fancy them."
</p><p>Yukito says, "We need a gurbah statue."
</p><p>Missoni says, "You were sitting. sorry."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "And you get .. uh, crimes against nature."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Either way you swing it."
</p><p>You say, "Okay ---"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Perigourd says, "Just ask Lydil about Shandits."
</p><p>You exclaim, "So, if no one has any further questions!"
</p><p>Bristenn exclaims, "She moved on from shandits!"
</p><p>You say, "Thank you all for coming out."
</p><p>Yukito asks, "Was it asking for a Gurbah statue, or Shandits?"
</p><p>Delindra mutters, "We JUST got this one, I wanted to keep her for a bit."
</p><p>Bristenn exclaims, "No one moves on from shandits, Thandiwe!"
</p><p>Casil says, "Last chance to hug me."
</p><p>Kippe says, "Thank you for all of your work.  Your work and your cohorts."
</p><p>Meliyara exclaims, "Thank you very much! It was an excellent year, and I'm excited for what's to come this year!"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Raelee says, "Just want to say thank you again, for everything you've done, for running this meeting, and I'm really excited about the upcoming year."
</p><p>Casil says, "Next time, I will be on fire."
</p><p>Lylia says, "No questions, just a sincere thank you for a huge amount of development, large and small, in the region and around the world."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Look forward to playing with you GMs this new year."
</p><p>Missoni says, "Thank you all for listening and for all you do."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Mynon says, "You may not have any idea how much this idea has circled around in this community."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Casil exclaims, "Great job!"
</p><p>Perigourd says, "Yes, thanks for all the info and time. Much appreciate all the hard work from you all."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Jisandra asks, "Oh so you're attending as Raelee next time?"
</p><p>Speaking to Jisandra, Casil says, "I might."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Guarrin exclaims, "Thank you for all the great work!"
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Avrey says, "You know I was just joking, right? I always love having all the GMs around, especially you and Spike."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "But yes, thank you for all your hard work.  It's been really great around here the last couple years."
</p><p>Yukito says, "You guys really paid attention to what we wanted and needed. You are the best."
</p><p>You say, "It has been my pleasure."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "(but seriously toss us some fun shan invasions every so often for no reason)"
</p><p>Casil says, "I like math. And magic. And probably books."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Meliyara says, "You need an owl to make it convincing."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Raelee says, "I like it.  We can go over my schedule later so you know where to cover for me."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Jisandra says, "....I want one of those....."
</p><p>Asheura exclaims, "Thank you very much for everything!"
</p><p>You exclaim, "Have a great night!"
</p><p>Speaking to Bristenn, Yukito says, "We DO have to christen the new barbican, yeah."
</p><p>Kippe agrees, "Shan invasions would be fun."
</p><p>You say, "Abyss will have invasions."
</p><p>Avrey exclaims, "Thanks again!"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Shandits arooo."
</p><p>Jisandra exclaims, "Thank you!"
</p><p>Speaking to you, Guarrin says, "Ooooo."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Perigourd says, "I knew you didn't build defenses for nothing."
</p><p>Yukito says, "Looking forward to it."
</p><p>Bristenn asks, "Shadowy invasions?"
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Thank you so much for doing this."
</p><p>Mynon says, "Vornavis, storyline events, the ambients...your 2023 here was incredible. Thank you so much."
</p><p>Lylia says, "Back to the Landing with me -- thanks again for letting me peek in."
</p><p>Speaking dryly to Perigourd, Meliyara says, "That's just to keep the dusk coven out."
</p><p>Kippe says, "Thank you for all of your work.  Your work and your cohorts."
</p><p>Speaking to Raelee, Lylia exclaims, "Had to get in that last hug!"
</p><p>Yukito exclaims, "Later folks!"
</p><p>Lachonus says, "Well, that was fun."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Venti fun."
</p><p>Speaking to Bristenn, Raelee says, "Now I want a latte."
</p><p>Guarrin exclaims, "Yeah!"
</p><p>Guarrin says, "Alright laaaaater."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Pistachio's back."
</p><p>Perigourd exclaims, "Gotta attend the kiddo a few minutes. See you all later!"
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Ok go off i guess quarrin."
</p><p>Guarrin says, "No pistachios on my latte."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "You .. shandit .. detractor."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Frickin' no one wants to fight furries as much as I."
</p><p>Missoni says, "Laterrr."
</p><p>Bristenn says, "Mostly uh, .. yes BYE."
</p><p>Lachonus yells, "Boathouse!"
