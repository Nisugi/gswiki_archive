Interested parties are welcome to make their way to the auditorium."

Raw cedar timbers perfume the air, comprising the walls of the expansive hall.  Living evergreen boughs contrast frame the southern entrance, brightly illuminated by faceted glimaerstone orbs set high into the ceiling.  The light scatters over a few dozen rows of comfortably padded seats and rugs covering parts of the polished floor.  A central aisle delineated by a quartet of braziers leads toward an expansive cedar and pine stage framed by silver-trimmed blue curtains.  You also see the Dendum disk and a stocky snow white puppy with oversized black-tipped paws.
Also here: Bakarus, Zeminar, Mayor Talliver, Hadya, Avaia, Roelon, Dendum who is sitting, Chronicler Opalina who is sitting, Defender of Mist Harbor Teaberry, Merrymaker Gespry who is sitting, Arianiss, Perigourd
Obvious exits: south

Arianiss slowly empties his lungs.

Speaking melodically to Talliver, Gespry asks, "Hows Reiphe doing?"

Speaking quietly to Gespry, Talliver says, "Recovering."

Bakarus says, "Eternal Light, to all."

Talliver asks, "Might I trouble the... active members of the Council for a moment before we begin the trial?"

Bakarus says, "At least I hope the truth will be shown clearly."

The black ora prayerbeads around Bakarus's neck is momentarily engulfed in a shroud of darkness!

The voice of Jiarine offers, "At least the crowd seems less blood thirsty at the moment and much smaller."

Hadya quietly says, "I'm sure you'll have your pint of blood, Scorpion."

Teaberry paces back and forth.

(OOC) Bakarus's player whispers to the group, "Little pre court bump of coke in the bathroom.  nice."

Gespry melodically says, "Sorry everyone..we are here.."

Speaking darkly to Talliver, Zeminar asks, "Has the plan been cemented?"

Hadya takes a moment to observe Talliver.

Speaking to Talliver, Jiarine asks, "Are you going to actually stay here this time?"

Jiarine asks, "Or has the important business more important than the trial of our scapegoat?"

Jiarine says, "Scapemule."

Talliver slowly empties his lungs.

Speaking to Teaberry, Talliver says, "I apologize sincerely for the delay."

Zeminar darkly says, "One moment."

Zeminar's group just went south.

Zeminar put a glass of Dhe'nari blood wine in his spidersilk cloak

Speaking to Talliver, Teaberry says, "It's all right. I am curious about what you were talking about..."

Teaberry exclaims, "Anyway. Time to start. Court is now in session!"

Speaking to Teaberry, Perigourd says, "If I'm not mistaken your honor, the defense was in the process of cross-examing former Councilman Arianiss, and attempting to present evidence not mentioned or related to his testimony during his original questioning. We object as per your statement that this is the proper time to introduce such evidence."

Speaking darkly to Arianiss, Zeminar says, "Mr. Winterfox, before the recess, we heard your testimony."

Speaking darkly to Arianiss, Zeminar says, "You stated Mr. Klysus had been possessed by the Lich Zeban."

Arianiss says, "Appeared to be, yes."

Speaking darkly to Arianiss, Zeminar asks, "Mr. Winterfox, are you aware that Mr. Klysus was issued a full apology regarding the forged letter incident?"

Arianiss says, "I am aware, yes."

Zeminar darkly says, "Very good."

Zeminar darkly asks, "Who do you think wrote those letters?"

Arianiss asks, "The ones that were found in Reiphe's home?"

Zeminar darkly says, "Eii."

Arianiss says, "I don't know."

Zeminar darkly says, "Very good.  No more questions for Mr. Winterfox, your honor."

Teaberry asks, "Very well, counselor. Does the prosecution have any questions?"

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "Were the letters found in Reiphes office ever proven to have been forged through hard evidence?"

Zeminar darkly says, "Mr Winterfox was their witness.  He's already been questioned."

Speaking to Zeminar, Perigourd says, "Redirect, sir, redirect."

Teaberry says, "Correct."

Arianiss asks, "Who is correct?"

Teaberry says, "They both are. You were already questioned by the prosecution, and redirect is possible after cross-examination."

Arianiss asks, "So answer the question?"

Zeminar darkly asks, "Can we not moves things along?"

Teaberry says, "Please answer the question, Mr. Winterfox."

Talliver turns an inquisitive ear toward Arianiss.

Speaking to Perigourd, Arianiss says, "I believe the evidence against Reiphe was enough to win over the majority, and hold him for questioning.  During his being taken to a more secure location his guards were attacked and he went missing.  We assumed he escaped.  I do not believe the notes were every verified, one way or another, their authenticity.  Were they written by Reiphe?  I don't know.  Were they written by someone else?  I don't know that either."

Perigourd says, "It does seem odd to issue a letter of apology to someone who hasn't been proven innocent of anything."

Perigourd says, "No more questions."

Perigourd says, "I'd like to call Aethyra Winterfox to question."

Bakarus says, "I always thought it was innocent until proven guilty."

Bakarus says, "Odd."

Speaking to Aethyra, Perigourd asks, "How are you this eve?"

Speaking hesitantly to Perigourd, Aethyra says, "I'm ok, thank you."

Speaking to Aethyra, Perigourd asks, "Can you tell us what you saw the night after the Crimson Legion was drilling in Icemule Trace?"

Aethyra says, "I saw a frightening presence in the shrine of Amasalen, and a pristine copy of the letter in question on the altar there."

Speaking to Aethyra, Perigourd asks, "And did this presence speak to you?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Aethyra says, "It did."

Perigourd asks, "What did it say?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Aethyra says, "The voice said, "A pity, this little discovery of yours. But he was just a catspaw, a distraction for you impudents to toy with while I worked. Run along. Tell them of his treachery if you want. Nothing can halt what I have put into motion now."."

Speaking to Aethyra, Perigourd asks, "Now the letter that was found, had you seen the full contents of that letter prior to going to the shrine of Amasalen?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Aethyra says, "The full contents, no. Only what was on the smudged copy dropped earlier in the evening."

Speaking to Aethyra, Perigourd asks, "Can you repeat what the full contents of the copy you found were?"

Zeminar darkly says, "Objection, irrelevant.  We are talking about corrupted evidence here...  Talliver confirmed the forged letters."

Perigourd says, "It is hardly irrelevant in establishing credibility to my witness."

Zeminar darkly says, "Credibly with forgeries."

Zeminar darkly says, "Credibility...."

Zeminar darkly asks, "Credibility from a witness at a shrine of... Amasalen?"

Zeminar darkly says, "Indeed..."

Speaking to Zeminar, Perigourd says, "Perhaps you'll wait for your cross-examination, council."

Speaking to Teaberry, Aethyra asks, "Do I answer the question?"

Teaberry says, "Objection overruled. Witness will answer the question. Gentlemen, please, let's keep this moving."

Zeminar darkly says, "Amazing."

Speaking to Perigourd, Aethyra says, "The letter said Arnabas, I certainly hope this missive finds you well. I wished to report that our sad little town has taken to finding aid from outside sources. Namely the Silver Gryphons and the Vaalorian Legion. A two pronged strategy where half assault your location and half remain in town for safety will be in place. Triage is to be in town center with a fallback at the gates of Voln. How quaint. I am not certain if any of this information is necessary, but I willingly provide it regardless. Your Servant, B."

Speaking to Aethyra, Perigourd asks, "You were also present on Niiman, the 27th of Lormesta, the night Reiphe O'Mallory was called in to be questioned by the townsfolk, were you not?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Aethyra says, "I was."

Speaking to Aethyra, Perigourd asks, "And you presented this same information to the Mayor and the public that night?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Aethyra says, "I did."

Speaking to Aethyra, Perigourd asks, "Did Bakarus say anything to you about the matter?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Aethyra says, "He whispered to me that I should be careful, that he heard that time in Amasalen's presence could cause one to go insane."

Speaking to Perigourd, Aethyra says, "I have mostly avoided Icemule since, but I keep running into him. I never feel safe in his presence."

Arianiss says, "Hrmm."

Speaking to Aethyra, Perigourd says, "Thank you. No more questions."

Speaking darkly to Aethyra, Zeminar says, "Mrs. Winterfox..."

Speaking darkly to Aethyra, Zeminar asks, "Amasalen is a well known threat in these parts.  You felt it odd for a Counsilor to tell you that you could be driven mad?"

Speaking to Zeminar, Aethyra says, "Given the timing and circumstances, his comment felt like a threat and a mockery."

Speaking darkly to Aethyra, Zeminar asks, "Do you feel you are perhaps already driven mad?  Spending so much time around these shrines?"

Perigourd says, "Objection, argumentative."

Speaking to Zeminar, Aethyra says, "I do not."

Speaking darkly to Aethyra, Zeminar asks, "The letter..  Signed with a B...  Along with the forgeries.  Are you certain that letter is from my client?"

Imperatrix Lylia just arrived.

Speaking to Zeminar, Aethyra says, "As I did not see him write it, I cannot swear to it, but I do know that he was the only one to hear the information contained in that letter and that he was the only one present when the information was whispered whose name starts with a B."

Talliver nods with satisfaction.

Speaking darkly to Aethyra, Zeminar asks, "We don't know who wrote it.  Would you say it's reasonable that my client is being framed?"

Speaking to Zeminar, Aethyra says, "I do not believe that is a reasonable assumption, no. No one heard that information in order to frame him."

Speaking darkly to Aethyra, Zeminar asks, "And, could you elaborate on the "private" information?"

Zeminar whispers to the group, "No further questions after this."

Perigourd says, "Objection, Arianiss already estalbished the private discussion in his testimony as to what was discussed and how."

Speaking to Zeminar, Aethyra says, "I was present when they were discussing the defense during the drills, and I was aware that Arianiss and Bakarus were having a whispered conversation at the same time."

Zeminar darkly says, "No further questions for this "witness" your honor."

Teaberry says, "You may sit down."

Perigourd says, "I would like to call the honorable Mayor Talliver Dabbings to questioning."

Talliver blinks.

Talliver says, "Very well."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "Mr. Mayor, you were also present the night Reiphe O'Mallory was brought in to be questioned by the townsfolk, weren't you?"

Talliver says, "I was, yes."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "And at that meeting you also stated that during an investigation several copies of a note had led you to believe that Bakarus was in league with the lich Zeban, is this true?"

Talliver says, "That is accurate."

Talliver stares at Bakarus.

Talliver says, "I still believe that."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "Did Aethyra have any access to the information of that investigation?"

Talliver says, "I don't believe that she would have, no."

Talliver says, "Not directly."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "Did the text of the note found during the aforementioned investigation correspond with the text of the duplicate note Aethyra testified as to finding?"

Talliver nods at Perigourd.

Talliver says, "It did."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "During Aethyra's recounting on the eve of that meeting Reiphe made two comments interrupting Aethyra while she was sharing her findings, for which you chastised him. Do you remember what Reiphe said and to whom he said it?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Talliver asks, "I don't.  Would you refresh my memory?"

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "Was it not "And remember the warning about the upside-down star!" and then specifically to Bakarus "Don't you think I didn't see your pentagram!"?"

Talliver takes a deep breath.

Talliver says, "He did say that, yes."

Teaberry says, "Leading the witness, counselor."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "Toward the end of this meeting, you had two guards escort Reiphe O'Mallory from the room back to await further trial, did you not?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Talliver says, "I did."

Zeminar darkly says, "Objection.  Irrelevant.  A warning from a witch about a witch warding Talisman."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "It was found a short time later that those guards had in fact been murdered, and Reiphe was no where to be found, correct?"

Teaberry says, "Sustained."

Talliver nods at Teaberry.

Speaking to Perigourd, Talliver says, "That's correct."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "There was a poison used to make sure those guards wouldn't speak again, wasn't there?"

Zeminar whispers to the group, "Mr. Klysus, you didn't poison any guards, did you?"

Talliver says, "Yes.  Luukosian deathwort."

Bakarus whispers to the group, "I did not."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "And in later investigations regarding this disappearance, a Vornavian bank note was discovered to have been in some way transacted with by the killer?"

Zeminar darkly asks, "Objection, relevance?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Talliver says, "Yes.  We deemed Vornavis to be the likely source due to the city's--"

Talliver glances at Teaberry.

Talliver seems to be waiting for something.

Perigourd says, "The relevance your honor is that Reiphe dissapeared shortly after being painted as a possible traitor by Bakarus himself."

Perigourd says, "And had a motive for the dissapearance of Reiphe."

Zeminar darkly asks, "So everyone from Vornavis is on trial now?"

Perigourd says, "Not everyone in Vornavis had a reason to harm Reiphe O'Mallory."

Perigourd says, "Nor had everyone in Vornavis just pointed to a symbol that a seer said would identify a traitor to Icemule."

Zeminar darkly says, "Objection, speculation."

Teaberry says, "Sustained."

Talliver's entire body tenses as he clenches his fist.

Speaking to Talliver, Jiarine says, "You are starting to look tense."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "Were you with the defenders at Berserker's end the night Zeban met his demise?"

Talliver takes a deep breath.

Speaking to Perigourd, Talliver says, "I was, yes, and when Bakarus's allegiances were revealed at last."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "And were you injured during the battle?"

Zeminar darkly says, "Speculation.  Please.  Objection."

Perigourd says, "This isn't speculation, it's a stated fact by a witness."

Zeminar darkly asks, "Bakarus's allegiances?"

Speaking to Zeminar, Perigourd says, "The witness is entitled to his opinion of observance, it is for the judge to decide whether to lend it credence or not."

Zeminar darkly says, "When Bakarus was so unfairly forced to act on behalf of the lich through the influence of its vile power...."

Zeminar darkly says, "But sure, opinions."

Zeminar sits down.

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "And were you injured during the battle?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Talliver says, "I was only slightly injured during the encounter with Zeban."

Perigourd amusedly says, "I'd call having a hand blown apart a bit more than minor."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "After Zeban had been torn apart by the Disir, and you were recovering from your wounds, isn't it true that Bakarus physically struck you?"

Talliver says, "Yes."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "Has he ever physically struck you before?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Talliver says, "No.  He turned against us because he was trying to defend the master he chose to serve."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd asks, "From your observations did Bakarus continue to goad and mock those around him including after the party had returned to Rawknuckles Tavern, clearly after Zeban's fall?"

Jiarine says, "Curious... you said US but I was not attacked personally."

Speaking to Perigourd, Talliver says, "Absolutely he did.  He mocked us well after Zeban was torn apart by the disir."

Speaking to Talliver, Perigourd says, "Thank you Mayor. No more questions your honor."

Talliver nods grimly at Perigourd.

Talliver glances at Zeminar.

Speaking darkly to Talliver, Zeminar asks, "Mayor Talliver, would you agree that Bakarus was, during that night, under the control of the Lich Zeban?"

Talliver says, "No."

Talliver says, "No on two counts."

Speaking darkly to Talliver, Zeminar asks, "All other witnesses testified to this?"

Perigourd says, "Objection, No witness has testified to the possession of Bakarus on the night in question."

Talliver says, "A lich has a phylactery that allows them to persist beyond injuries that would normally cause death."

Speaking darkly to Talliver, Zeminar says, "Are you aware that a liches control can extend past their untimely demise?  There are several historical occurrences of this."

Speaking to Zeminar, Talliver says, "Zeban was no lich."

Zeminar darkly asks, "Oh?  What was Zeban?"

Talliver says, "Moreover, if he could command Bakarus surreptitiously, I fail to see why he shouted out orders to his catspaw."

Speaking darkly to Talliver, Zeminar asks, "You seem to know an awful lot about Zeban.  Tell me, what was he?"

Speaking to Zeminar, Talliver says, "Zeban was whatever a lich is when it no longer has a phylactery.  We witnessed him occupy multiple bodies."

Zeminar darkly asks, "Including Bakaurs?"

Talliver says, "No.  The bodies that he occupied decayed beyond usefulness rapidly, all except for the body of Arnabas."

Speaking darkly to Teaberry, Zeminar says, "No further questions for the esteemed mayor Talliver," as he chuckles, "who didn't seem to see the same thing all other witnesses did."

Talliver scowls at Zeminar.

Teaberry asks, "Any further witnesses?"

Perigourd says, "The prosecution now calls Sorlu Jae'kym for questioning."

Speaking to Teaberry, Sorlu assures, "And let me state here and now that I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth...so lash me Ivas."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "You were the one who found the Tablet of Life, correct?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "That is correct."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "And this tablet was also sought by the lich Zeban?"

Sorlu says, "It was, yes."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "Did someone approach you looking to acquire the tablet on behalf of the lich Zeban?"

Sorlu says, "Zeban himself, but often I would notice shadows stalking after me."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "When and how did you meet Bakarus?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "I have know Bakarus now for several years. Since my return to Icemule, well before this whole mess started."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "And did he ever approach you regarding the Tablet of Life?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "No. I approached him."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "Why?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "Well, as we all know, and have heard repeated several times....Darcena was the one to point out that he may be the spy. A little too fast, if you ask me. As she did seem to know even before the seer could finish speaking those words of warning. And so, picking up on this, I wished to investigate myself."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "And what did you and Bakarus discuss when you approached him?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "I offered the Tablet to him, of course. I needed to know his reaction."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "And what was his reaction?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "Unlike the man I had seen before, he seemed to fill with excitement....it was quite odd. I had not suspected him, it did not seem to fit his character, but in the presence of the Tablet I could sense a sudden darkness within him grow. A lust, a desire for it....if I didn't know better, I would think he was moved by Ivas herself."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "And did you give him the Tablet?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "No, I would not. And had no plans to. The survival and security of this town, this place I call home, is what matters most to my heart. I only wished to tempt him with the promise of it, of it being delivered to Zeban, in the hopes that it would buy us time."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "Prior to the night of Zebans demise, there was a decided lull in Zeban's advances on the town. Was the offer of this tablet in any way involved?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "I believe my deception is what allowed that to happen, yes."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "And the night Zeban was destroyed, did Bakarus murder you?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu mutters, "He did."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "Because you would not relinquish the tablet to him as agreed?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "I did not expect him to move with the speed he did. When I took a moment to tease Zeban, and it was known I would not be handing it over, that is when I was struck down."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "You met with him on multiple occasions to plan this proposed transaction, did you not?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "I did. To assure that we were still aligned in that regard....or at least make sure he believed us to be."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "Based on your conversations with him, what do you think he hoped to achieve by giving Zeban the Tablet of Life?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "Quite possibly the same reward Zeban offered me if I should hand it over. Power....control over this town. Promises of all that we desire."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd says, "Thank you, no more questions."

Speaking darkly to Sorlu, Zeminar asks, "Mr. Mr. Jae'kym, you said a darkness grew within Bakarus.  Yes?"

Speaking to Zeminar, Sorlu says, "I did."

Speaking darkly to Sorlu, Zeminar asks, "And you said he moved with unnatural speed?  Do you believe my client was under the influence of the lich Zeban?"

Speaking to Zeminar, Sorlu says, "I am no expert on the supernatural, but I do not believe it beyond possibility."

Speaking darkly to Sorlu, Zeminar asks, "Why would Zeban be controlling Bakarus?"

Speaking to Zeminar, Sorlu asks, "Zeban controlled many. Why would he not try to use a member of our town council for his ill will?"

Sorlu says, "And I suppose, at least initially, he was not a suspected doer of evil."

Speaking darkly to Sorlu, Zeminar asks, "Perhaps to unite the tablets?"

Perigourd says, "Objection, calls for speculation."

Sorlu says, "Ah, yes, that was Zeban's goal."


Speaking darkly to Sorlu, Zeminar asks, "Mr. Jae'kym, in the time you have known my client, would you consider Bakarus to be a good counselor for this fair city?  Before these tragic events?"

Speaking to Zeminar, Sorlu says, "I have spent a lifetime working amongst less than ideal people. Bakarus never seemed like one to me. In fact, I've seen him make decisions that did not seem to line up with the wishes of Zeban."

Speaking to Zeminar, Sorlu says, "So in that regard, yes."

Speaking darkly to Sorlu, Zeminar asks, "While we have determined that Bakarus's physical body murdered you... who would you say is responsible for your demise on the wretched night?  The lich Zeban, or Mr. Klysus?"

Speaking to Zeminar, Sorlu says, "My eyes look always towards the source, not the symptom. So to me, it is Zeban who is responsible for my death."

Zeminar darkly says, "No further questions, your honor..."

Perigourd says, "Redirect, your honor."

Teaberry says, "Go on."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "You said you can neither confirm nor deny that Bakarus was possessed the night he murdered you?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Sorlu says, "That is true."

Zeminar darkly says, "Objection, badgering.  We have already covered this."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "And while Zeban put events into motion that led to the situation where you were murdered, It was in fact Bakarus who slew you, was it not?"

Zeminar darkly says, "Same objection."

Teaberry says, "Asked and answered, counselor. Move along."

Speaking to Sorlu, Perigourd asks, "Is Bakarus a follower of Luukos?"

Zeminar darkly asks, "Objection, relevance to this trial?"

Teaberry says, "Sustained."

Talliver almost gets to his feet, but visibly calms himself and sits.

Perigourd says, "No more questions your honor."

Perigourd says, "The prosecution rests its case."

Talliver whispers something to Perigourd.

Speaking darkly to Teaberry, Zeminar says, "Your honor, the defense calls no further witnesses."

Speaking to Teaberry, Perigourd says, "If it pleases the court."

Teaberry says, "Proceed, counselor."

Perigourd says, "Lets look at what we know. We know that a seer provided a warning to Icemule about a traitor to the town and even described a manner in which to recognize them, and that this symbol was seen and recognized by not one, but two separate individuals, Darcena and Reiphe O'Mallory. We know that Darcena attempted to warn several people that Bakarus was a traitor in pointing this out, and that Reiphe's comments during the meeting of his question were likewise ignored."

Perigourd says, "We know that information was being passed by this traitor to the Lich Zeban, and that a note was recovered with details known only to Arianiss and Bakarus, and which was signed with the initial B."

Perigourd says, "We know that when a note with the exact same information was discovered at a shrine to Amasalen, the Arkati that the council of ten served, by Aethyra, and that this note contained the exact same information as the first note, information which Aethyra wasn't privy to, and that this note was then destroyed by a manifestation of Zeban, who then threatened her, and admitting the spies treasonous nature."

Perigourd says, "We know that shortly after a meeting where Aethyra and Reiphe were attempting to point out that the traitor was Bakarus that one of them was ignored and left out of fear, and the other disappeared in a mysterious murder where Luukosian deathwart was used to prevent any possible identification of the attacker."

Perigourd says, "We know that the traitor was in fact Bakarus, who was attempting to gain the tablet of life for Zeban through negotiations with Sorlu who held it, and who he believed would turn it over to him when the truth is Sorlu's tactic was devised to keep the bloodshed from Icemule's doorstep."

Perigourd says, "We know that on the night of Zeban's demise, when it was clear Sorlu wasn't going to turn over the tablet, Sorlu was murdered by Bakarus in order for Zeban to claim the tablet of life, and that after the Disir had already torn Zeban apart, he not only continued to mock and goad those gathered, but struck the very mayor of this township without any seeming provocation."

Perigourd says, "Why would a lich have to command someone to right down information on a note to leave at a shrine in order to pass that information on to themself? The fact is they wouldn't need to."

Perigourd says, "This led to a second consideration. If Bakarus wasn't in fact possessed, why write down and pass information to Zeban if he wanted what was best for the town? The truth is there was only one answer that made sense.  Bakarus wrote that note because he didn't care one bit for the townsfolk, their betterment or their safety. He was the traitor. He wasn't in fact possessed, he was lying."

Perigourd says, "And why did Bakarus try so hard to push all the blame from himself?  Because as was made clear from Aethyra's encounter with Zeban, Zeban didn't care if Bakarus had been discovered or not. This meant the only one harmed by Bakarus being revealed as the traitor was himself. He had to deflect all the blame from himself not because he was possessed, but because he was lying."

Perigourd says, "And when it was clear that Sorlu was not going to honor their agreement to hand the tablet over to either him or Zeban, Zeban forced Bakarus to take action, not through possession, but through revealing to those gathered that Bakarus was in fact the traitor in pleading for his aid. Thus Bakarus murdered Sorlu of his own volition having been exposed and having nothing left to lose. Others might have understood this better except that murdering Sorlu caused the kind of momentary chaos that Luukosians thrive in, that chaos of uncertainty."

Perigourd says, "It was then that Bakarus took his moment to indulge in castigating those around him, quoting Luukosian phrases, calling people fools, about how easily we were misled, even striking the mayor physically when he was still recovering from his wounds during the stalwart stand against Zeban."

Perigourd asks, "And as the dust started settling a thought occurred to him. Had he not gotten this far by doing the thing he was best at? Had he not achieved an end that would satisfy Luukos, his master, in helping corrupt the Angargreft ? Taken some measure of victory out of those around him? Could he not retain his position on the council and relish once more the defeat of those around him which gave him so much pleasure?"

Perigourd says, "Yes, all these things were within his reach, if he did what he was best at."

Perigourd says, "Lying."

Perigourd says, "Thank you."

You say, "Indeed."

Teaberry says, "Go ahead, Counselor."

You say, "It was a strange thing that happened the other night. There was this stunted halfling 'bloodspeaker' up in the Boreal Forest..."

You say, "Ritualistically burned, scarred, misshapen. Gurgling and garbling. Until it came across a dead body."

You say, "It clawed its way through the chest of the corpse, then ripped out the heart and ate it."

You say, "Suddenly, its skin was ripped apart as it rapidly grew until it was several heads taller than a giantman, sprouting bloodstained antlers from its skull."

You say, "Now, I cannot quite put my finger on it, I do not know what it was exactly..."

You say, "But something about this did not seem to be entirely natural."

You say, "The Truefolk up there get a certain fever for cannibalism sometimes. After all, who doesn't? But these ones were the disciples of Zeban."

You say, "There are also flayed gigas of his up near Angargreft. I saw one tear the fabric of reality, which then lashed out with tentacles."

You say, "Maybe Zeban handed out pamphlets, held some convincing seminars. His willing followers still keeping up the good fight."

You say, "But there is just this nagging suspicion that, even though Zeban was destroyed by the Disir..."

You say, "... that maybe, somehow, these halflings and gigas are not quite themselves."

You say, "You see, they are not 'possessed', not puppets. Zeban is gone."

You say, "But it is perhaps too generous, far too generous, to suggest their will is not compromised."

You say, "So. We have this problem of Zeban victimizing Bakarus."

You say, "Is it disputed that the Council of Ten liches would possess others, whether partly or wholly? No."

You say, "Is it disputed that those liches would cause the possessed to have visions? No."

You say, "Is it disputed that Zeban spoke through Bakarus? No."

You say, "Do the undead compel actions in others? Yes."

You ask, "Is it necessarily obvious when those liches were partly or wholly possessing others?"

You say, "Thurfel was thought to be living. It turned out a divination crystal from his Keep was his broken phylactery."

You say, "Ellerel ran for Mayor without it being known that he was actually Prangar."

You exclaim, "How much more subtle it is when all you need is compromised will!"

JYou say, "Zeban issued a command to Bakarus. Bakarus suddenly obeyed."

You say, "Sorlu himself said he believes Zeban was at fault."

You ask, "Does it really matter he did it by venting out loud instead of waving a hand?"

You say, "Bakarus attempted to warn others of his visions."

You say, "His hand is marked by the lich."

You say, "You know who else would mark others with corpseflesh? The Lich King, Barnom Slim. Whose phylactery was destroyed in 5113 and he was consumed by shadows."

You say, "... and yet, Barnom returned, possessing a host body in spring of 5120. Very shortly before all of this began in Icemule."

You say, "Imagine that. Known associate of Luukosians. Known for his manipulations across towns. Himself a demi-lich."

You say, "That is quite the coincidence. Such proximity for 'B' to not be involved with 'Z'."

You ask, "Those love letters, after all, are only signed 'B'. Was this ever questioned?"

You say, "Then you have this seer, Kadya, who one imagines could have 'seen' any sort of private meeting, including defense plans for the town."

You say, "Somehow a seer is to be used as a proof of secret knowledge in one way, but we are to believe not in other ways."

You say, "This is a witch who says her powers come from Eorgina. Queen of the Dark Gods. Ruler of the pantheon of Luukos and Amasalen."

You ask, "What proof does this witch offer that the town will be betrayed by someone wearing an inverted star?"

You say, "Which, after all, is an ancient symbol of protection, against witchcraft."

You ask, "Is this meaningfully different from just another accusation through one layer of indirection?"

You say, "All we really know from this is that a seer wished to place guilt on the wearer."

You say, "That there were forces wanting blame to fall on Bakarus seems clear enough."

You say, "Some sort of 'catspaw' for what sounds like an Andelasian manipulator."

You say, "But what we do not have is any compelling reason to believe Bakarus did not have his will compromised by Zeban."

You say, "Possession is nine-tenths of the law. We have every reason to believe Bakarus was not himself."

You say, "Instead of trying to help him, making sure he is well, here we are persecuting him."

You say, "This is, in the end, nothing but immense reasonable doubt and hearsay."

You conclude, "There is only one right choice here, and that is to dismiss all charges."

You say, "Thank you."

Speaking darkly to Teaberry, Zeminar asks, "Well, your honor?"

Perigourd says, "I suggest we allow the Judge his time to render his decision."

Lylia asks, "Did we suddenly become a circus and not a courtroom?"

Speaking quietly to Lylia, Hadya says, "It certainly seems to be that way."

You dryly say, "If the hand itches, you must blame the liches."

Bakarus says, "I am so tired."

Teaberry says, "All right. Court is adjourned while I consider my verdict. And it will be given tonight."

Speaking sharply to Bakarus, Talliver says, "Treachery must be exhausting work."

Speaking darkly to Talliver, Zeminar asks, "You could say the same about corruption?"

Speaking to Talliver, Bakarus says, "I've apologized as much as I can Mayor, such tragedy."

Talliver holds up a hand in Bakarus's direction and shakes his head.

Rammael gives a polite nod of his head.

You see Rammael the Clerk.
He appears to be a Half-Sylvan.
He is short and has a lithe physique.  He appears to be in the flower of life.  He has heavy-lidded ale brown eyes and tanned skin.  He has lank, dark blond hair that is starting to silver at the temples.  He has an angular face, an unforgiving nose and thin lips.
He is in good shape.
He is wearing a dark peaked hat adorned with a single yellow feather, a woven steel neckchain suspending a piece of chatoyant golden quartz, a combed dark woolen doublet adorned with an even march of golden buttons, a collared cream cotton shirt, a pair of heavy leather gloves, a pair of dark wool pants, and some dark cuffed slouch boots.

Rammael softly says, "Not at all.  As I was charged with ensuring Judge Teaberry had the support she needed, I returned to assist."

Teaberry says, "Thank you, Rammael."

Teaberry says, "All right, court is again in session."

Teaberry says, "First of all, I want to thank you all for attending. I know that many of you would rather be at the Feast in the Iyo Glade on the Isle of Four Winds."

Geijon asks, "If Bakarus is guilty, do th' Angargeist ghosts go away in th' Hinterwilds?"

Teaberry says, "Second, this was a tough case to decide. There were many gaps and a lot of speculation in the prosecutor's case. The possession defense didn't wholly convince me, but there have been many possessions over the past year and a half, so I can't wholly discount it.  I think, ultimately, that I have to say that I think Bakarus did write the letter signed with a B, but I don't know if he was possessed, treasonous, or playing the spy game with Zeban as Sorlu did with him.  I don't know if he injured the mayor accidentally or deliberately.  It's a muddle."

Teaberry says, "It's therefore my decision that Bakarus is guilty of second -degree murder and second-degree assault. As to the charge of treason, his actions are deeply suspicious, but there is insufficient proof that he acted willingly or maliciously.   I have to go with the Paradis Verdict--not proven."

Speaking to Teaberry, Rammael says, "Thank you for your considered effort toward impartial justice."

Rammael says, "The remaining Town Councillors have heard the verdict provided by this court."

Speaking to Geijon, Bakarus says, "Everyone loves a peanut gallery."

Speaking to Bakarus, you say, "In the Landing they made one of Barnom Slim's disciples the Mayor."
