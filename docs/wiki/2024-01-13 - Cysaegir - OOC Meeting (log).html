<p>•    A fishing spot - on the list to look at
</p><p>•    Possibility of Glimae'den lore - on the list to look at
</p><p>•    Suggestion for an animal sanctuary - will be added to the list
</p><p>•    More detail about the town's Governance is already being looked at
</p><p>•    Pastoral feel to the town - lends itself well to crafting - barn raising, quilting, weaving, cheesemaking, possibly having supplies of wood for the WoodChopper box
</p><p>•    Connections with the Aelotoi Embassy in Ta'Illistim (Ambassadors)
</p><p>•    Defensively oriented discussions about The Hive - Xeraphina is not very strong when it comes to invasions and invasion type things so may consider it when looking at the Governance angle.
</p><p>•    Inclusion in global storylines - chapter of Chronicles of Noraellen slated to take place in Cysaegir.
</p><p>•    Request for possible forage props of aelotoi materials e.g zydris (like the lasimor tree in Ta'Vaalor)
</p><p>•    Loose discussion around player-run markets being tried in Cysaegir
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Log">Log</span></h2>
<p>Xeraphina introduces, "Hello, everyone.  I'm Xeraphina, your new Cysaegir guru.  Some of you may know me from such hits as the Player Wiki, an adorable awkward cadet in Ta'Vaalor, and the poor, poor Orelwen, the ever-poisoned."
</p><p>Speaking to her vultite helm, Xeraphina says, "Not even sure how that got there."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Casil, Rohese mocks, "We outnumber you now!"
</p><p>Jaysehn asks, "Oh...I did a good?"
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "So, I am very clearly new to this role, so I'm getting my feet wet, but I wanted to touch on a few things before I open it up to questions, comments, concerns, and quandaries."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "First off, I love aelotoi, they rank in my top favorite races, and when I expressed interest in taking on the role of Cysaegir guru, I was asked if I wanted to additionally be the aelotoi guru, which I said yes.  I have a lot of affection for them, and especially since that means I can continue to add to the Elven Nations from my own little corner."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I've been going through the notes I have, and to cover some things from this past year, as part of Enter the Refugees storyline, we had two new shops open up, Waste Not, which is the grocer, and Absolute Scentsibility, which is a perfume shop."
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "And they're both fantastic, so thank you."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "GM Xynwen did the perfume shop and GM Thandiwe did the grocer."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "Additionally, and unfortunately, I don't know an exact timeline, we did have a post office/shop open up, and that can be found on the second level of Rhyaesdid Hall."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "So, that's the most recent history of what has been accomplished here."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "So, goals.  I don't like to make promises unless I know it's 100% in the pipeline, but as I've been basically walking the town and inventorying things, I'm taking notes on some of the things I'd like to accomplish here this year.  I can be vague, at least, with some of these things because they'll be easier and/or quicker than other things that may take a bit more time."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "First off, I'd like to get into some of the shops to update inventories, and maybe do a little renovation while I'm there.  This would additionally coincide with the goal of having an NPC here that can fancy up some items."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I want to build some things, as well, but again, I don't want to go too into detail and make a promise that I can't keep until I know where I'm at and what I can do, which comes after my inventorying of the town.  I do want to hold some RP-events, some of which will be aelotoi-centric, though they will also be open to everyone to attend.  The aelotoi have been here for over 20 years, and we even have a new culture, so I would like to do more to exhibit their presence in this town."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "While I'm reluctant to openly speak about the ideas I have because, again, promises being kept, hopes dreams and dashing and all that, I do have plans to build it up and also work with our other lovely EN gurus to continue to drive the RP out here."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Xeraphina, Rohese quotes, "If you build it, they will come."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I have already thrown some ideas to the other GMs present, so they can speak to my random, somewhat chaotic but also very on point, ideas to improve this area."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "So, like I said, my part wasn't going to be super long because I haven't been in the role long enough to give very specific points of progress.  With that, I'll go ahead and open it up for questions, comments, concerns, quandaries, etc.  Please raise hands to keep it less chaotic than my thought process."
</p><p>Speaking to Rohese, Xeraphina asks, "Yes, ma'am?"
</p><p>Speaking softly to Xeraphina, Rohese says, "Two things, really.  One rather specific and the other more generally lore-based."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "Sure."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Xeraphina, Rohese says, "First, I'm asking on behalf of Mirkk if there is the possibility of having a fishing hole in the town."
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "I know Xynwen kindly offered to look into it not long ago."
</p><p>Speaking to Rohese, Xeraphina says, "That is a very good question, and that's in my list of things that I am looking at to improve but I don't want to make a super promise on just yet until I have a better idea of things."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Xeraphina, Rohese says, "Thank you, as long as it's on the list."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Xeraphina asks, "Is it on the list?"
</p><p>Casil asks, "Oh, am I taking notes?"
</p><p>Casil says, "Yes."
</p><p>Xynwen exclaims, "I had it on my list but hadn't looked at it, so now it's on her list, and she'll definitely look at it!"
</p><p>Speaking softly to Xynwen, Rohese says, "Well played."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I have a lot of working lists, some things are higher on the lists than others.  Just ask anyone who asks me about wiki stuff."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "But yes, this is on my list for sure."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Xeraphina, Rohese asks, "Secondly - and I am very conscious that this is a sensitive subject - but might we see any more lore on the Glimae'den and the history behind it?"
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Xeraphina says, "Am I giving off psychic projections?  I feel like it's been like this all week."
</p><p>Tikba says, "HOW DARE YOU I'm kidding I would like to know more about Glimae'den too."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Tikba, Rohese mouths, "I still love you."
</p><p>Speaking to Rohese, Xeraphina says, "Not to get too into detail or again, promises, but there has definitely been some background discussion about certain things that I may want to look into building up."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "So, it's on a list."
</p><p>Rohese softly exclaims, "I am loving this list!"
</p><p>Xeraphina asks, "Next question?"
</p><p>Speaking to Zarana, Xeraphina asks, "I'm sorry, did you raise your hand?  I may have missed it.  What was your question?"
</p><p>Speaking to Xeraphina, Zarana says, "It was my fault, I forgot to wait until Rohese asked her second question."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "No, not your fault.  I need to highlight certain things."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "If I don't, I lose them really quickly."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Zarana, Rohese says, "All good, I will keep asking questions unless someone stops me."
</p><p>Zarana says, "I heard that Solhaven is getting a permanent petting zoo, and that made me curious whether we could investigate the possibility of some sort of animal sanctuary here, as Cysaegir is a sanctuary of sorts, for something similar on this side of the Dragonspine."
</p><p>Rohese softly exclaims, "That's a lovely idea!"
</p><p>Rohese softly suggests, "A butterfly house!"
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I believe Solhaven already has a permanent petting zoo.  However, that is something to think about.  I'm definitely taking notes, so that's a good suggestion."
</p><p>Zarana says, "Thank you.  Just a thought I had."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "Random thoughts are oftentimes the best thoughts."
</p><p>Speaking to Tikba, Xeraphina says, "Go ahead."
</p><p>Tikba exclaims, "I wanted to say I'm excited for you to be the Cysaegir and aelotoi guru!"
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "Aww, thank you!  The outpouring of appreciation has been very great."
</p><p>Tikba says, "You are probably already thinking about it but I would really like to know more about how Cysaegir's governance, or lack thereof, works."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Xeraphina asks, "Seriously... do I need a tinfoil hat?"
</p><p>Rohese softly notes, "That Magistrate is quite intimidating!"
</p><p>Casil says, "That was literally the first thing she said to me about things she wanted to think about."
</p><p>Tikba exclaims, "Great!"
</p><p>Speaking to Tikba, Xeraphina says, "This is actually something I've been musing on myself here, which, as Casil can attest, has already been on my mind."
</p><p>Speaking to Xeraphina, Nylyn exclaims, "You're clearly just very in tune with the people!"
</p><p>Speaking to Nylyn, Xeraphina exclaims, "So it would seem!"
</p><p>You say, "Yes, Solhaven had a pettting zoo but it got lost when the city 'drowned' so I'm returning it."
</p><p>Nylyn says, "Oh wow, those poor animals."
</p><p>Zarana says, "I was very interested in the part about being able to milk the animals in the permanent zoo."
</p><p>Nylyn exclaims, "Cysaegir cheese!"
</p><p>Casil says, "Milk the dragonfly."
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Xeraphina says, "... I have questions..."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Casil, Rohese says, "Eww."
</p><p>You say, "I do not want the answers to those questions...."
</p><p>Speaking to Tikba, Xeraphina says, "But back to your question, yes, this is on my mind.  It's something that has had a vague background discussion and will need to have further thought put into it, especially given how young it would ultimately be."
</p><p>Xeraphina asks, "Before I ask for more questions, does anyone have any ideas as to what sorts of RP events you would like to see?"
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "Well, more Rumplesnoots, of course."
</p><p>Xynwen exclaims, "Rumplesnoots will make the Elanith rounds!"
</p><p>Tikba says, "I have always thought of Cysaegir as pretty pastoral so my first inclination is genuinely like, let's do a barn raising or something."
</p><p>Lissaya suggests, "Cozy vibes, crafty things?"
</p><p>Casil says, "Cottagecore."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Seems well suited to slice of life."
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "It's such a pretty town and would lend itself well to a lot of crafting vibess."
</p><p>Lissaya says, "Barn raising, quilting, weaving, cheesemaking contest..."
</p><p>Oishian says, "I truly enjoyed the opening of the Hive, though it was well over my head, in terms of threat level, so any RP/storyline concerning the Kiramon interests me."
</p><p>Tikba says, "And an opportunity to meet local NPCs in a low pressure situation."
</p><p>Zarana says, "It seems to have a lot of jewelry and artisan shops."
</p><p>Zarana asks, "On that note, might there be any plans to add to the Cysaegir cobbling warehouse?"
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Also might allow for a more promiment NPC to push into other towns for larger events in the way that the off camera elf cities have envoys."
</p><p>Speaking to Zarana, Xeraphina says, "It's on my list as part of potential shop updates."
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "Links with the Aelotoi Embassy."
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "In Ta'Illistim."
</p><p>Tikba asks, "Unironiicaly is there an aelotoi embassy?"
</p><p>Jaysehn exclaims, "I admit, I'm pretty ignorant about all that. But sounds good!"
</p><p>Tikba says, "I gotta go see that."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Tikba, Rohese exclaims, "There is!"
</p><p>Speaking to Tikba, Zarana says, "I think there is.  The embassies are in Ta'illistim."
</p><p>Xeraphina asks, "Is there an embassy in Ta'Illistim for aelotoi?"
</p><p>Speaking softly to Tikba, Rohese says, "It's a lovely spot I often visit."
</p><p>Elysani says, "I've got plans for them, but that's a tomorrow thing."
</p><p>Speaking to Elysani, Xeraphina asks, "Future Elysani problem?"
</p><p>Elysani exclaims, "It's in my notes!"
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "Okay, yes, I pulled up the map and do see the embassy.  I don't know why I didn't think there was one there."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "Okay, so goverence, crafting, ambassadors..."
</p><p>Tikba says, "To back up Oishian, it would make sense to have some more defensively oriented discussions too. The Hive has got to be a worry for some folks."
</p><p>Zarana says, "On the crafting note and the nature theme, it would also be amazing to have a wood shop to have blocks of wood that work with things like... the WoodChopper.  More common types than are available at special events."
</p><p>Nylyn exclaims, "I was just gifted a WoodChopper, so uh, yes please!"
</p><p>Rohese jokingly exclaims, "As long as we don't see deforestation of the Glimae'den Wildwood!"
</p><p>Speaking to Tikba, Xeraphina says, "So I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not very strong when it comes to invasions and invasion type things.  So how that may lend to this may be worth considering.  It it something to consider when looking at the governence, however."
</p><p>Speaking to Zarana, Xeraphina says, "Oh, goody!  I had a lot of fun making the WoodChopper box.,"
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "It's wonderful to hear how loved it is."
</p><p>Zarana says, "It's very versatile."
</p><p>Zarana exclaims, "More so with more woods!"
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I don't want to make a promise that a shop like that will exist, but I'll definitely add that to my list of considerations."
</p><p>Zarana says, "All we can do is ask."
</p><p>Zarana says, "Thank you for considering it."
</p><p>Rohese softly repeats, "I'm liking the list."
</p><p>Nylyn says, "I was trying to chant "Wood. Shop. Wood. Shop."."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I have a lot of working lists, some things get prioritized higher based on how quickly they can be handled while others may be further down because there are more moving parts to them."
</p><p>Speaking to Rohese, Lissaya encourages, "Keep going."
</p><p>Nylyn says, "I'm excited to be at OOC meeting, Nylyn's usually very serious."
</p><p>Xeraphina asks, "Did anyone have any other questions, comments, concerns, or other c/q words to add to the mix?"
</p><p>Rohese softly asks, "Are there plans to include Cysaegir in a future global storyline?"
</p><p>Speaking to Rohese, Xeraphina says, "SEE! I MISSED IT."
</p><p>Speaking to Rohese, Jaysehn says, "Volnco is expanding."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I will defer to the lovely Thandiwe on that."
</p><p>You say, "There is a chapter of Chronicles of Noraellen slated to take place here, yes."
</p><p>Rohese softly exclaims, "I just love excuses to come back to my cottage here so thank you!"
</p><p>Speaking to Rohese, Nylyn says, "Ooo I'm so jealous."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Nylyn, Rohese says, "Honestly, I adore it."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I would definitely love to see more faces here.  I realize we're in a weird spot right now, but hopefully my presence will help build it up more."
</p><p>Nylyn says, "I love it here but feel like I don't make it out here enough. Very excited for any and all RP opportunities coming our way."
</p><p>Jaysehn asks, "I'm a big fan of when cultures/races have materials and crafts tied to them. Kalyrra over here tells me zydris is an Aelotoi thing. I'm pretty sure that tree near Mistwatch can be plucked for lassimor weavables/fodder/something. Is there something like that for zydris around here?"
</p><p>Speaking softly to Jaysehn, Rohese exclaims, "Good question!"
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "If I'm wrong, blame her."
</p><p>Zarana asks, "There's a tree in Mistwatch with lasimor?"
</p><p>Casil says, "Just outside mistwatch, yeah."
</p><p>You say, "Yes, but it doesn't give 'rare fodder'."
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "Twigs and leaves."
</p><p>Lissaya says, "I deleafed that poor tree hard for Solstice gifts."
</p><p>Tikba says, "A zydris tree would be pretty cool."
</p><p>Tikba says, "The post office back room is the only place I know of outside of EG to get zydris."
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "But very rare drops and ..."
</p><p>Tikba exclaims, "And it's expensive!"
</p><p>You say, "Mostly for crafting not for large projects."
</p><p>Jaysehn asks, "Its like weavable something?"
</p><p>Zarana says, "Those are still desired."
</p><p>You say, "You can use it like you would a foraged stick."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "From what I can tell, no.  That being said, I'm not going to say anything either way about the possibility of it appearing."
</p><p>Lissaya says, "Give us alllll the forage item props."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Neat thanks. Also its nice to see long time staff move into new roles with more responsibilities. Its reassuring."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "There are a few new aelotoi materials too from this year."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "Plus the ceremony of remembrance is theirs."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Royal jelly makeup will be the hit of the season."
</p><p>You say, "Took place here for the first time 20 years ago."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Smear yourself in krolvin juice."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I wouldn't say I'm longtime staff.  It's only been... 5... years... since I started."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Uh..kiramon."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "That one."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Makes you a gnarly vet in my book."
</p><p>Speaking uncertainly to Jaysehn, Xeraphina asks, "Is that like milking the dragonfly?"
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Sure. Lets get weird."
</p><p>Zarana asks, "I don't know if anyone remembers the Grawood festival?"
</p><p>You say, "From River's Rest, yes."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I regret asking that question."
</p><p>Elysani says, "I loved that place."
</p><p>Tikba says, "If we are in the silly portion of the meeting, please build a huge slide that starts here and ends in the Hive."
</p><p>Zarana says, "Now that we have an actual cooking system and pies, and the Solstice Market was a huge hit, it would be amazing to have some sort of gathering here to do activities like that like the barn raising suggested."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "I mean..."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Tikba talking sense here."
</p><p>Zarana says, "I think of Cysaegir as a sort of refuge from the combat and hunting I do when in Ta'illistim or Ta'vaalor, but that might be my personal opinion also."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Zarana, Rohese says, "I do too, to be honest.  It's my "getaway from it all" place."
</p><p>Casil says, "The more y'all talk, the more I see it as a hippie, animal-loving art commune."
</p><p>Speaking to Zarana, Xeraphina says, "It is something to look into, certainly."
</p><p>Speaking to Xeraphina, Zarana exclaims, "Thank you!"
</p><p>Speaking to Casil, Xeraphina says, "I mean, my people..."
</p><p>Nylyn says, "Oh wow a barn raising with a crafter's/farmer's market."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "Welcome to Woodstock."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Casil, Rohese says, "You see Rohese the Tree Hugging Hippie."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "I may not promises... but I can look into it."
</p><p>Lissaya says, "Agricultural fair."
</p><p>Oishian says, "Bah, it's the non-aelotoi who see that.The winged folk see a fight for survival."
</p><p>Lissaya says, "Like a mini Big E, for you New Englanders."
</p><p>You say, "So... If I may comment on that..."
</p><p>Speaking to Oishian, Nylyn exclaims, "We've earned our rest!"
</p><p>Nylyn says, "Let's get idyllic."
</p><p>Xeraphina asks, "Okay, it's 6pm.  Did anyone have anything else they would like to ask or share?"
</p><p>You say, "There is a lot of work that goes into these fairs and festivals.  The Winter Traveling one takes weeks of work and we all have some pretty strong commitments throughout the year.  We also have to be careful not to overload our QC team with all of our wishes and desires.  As such, there are exactly two "small free festivals" that take place every year.  Those are already plotted for the next couple of years.  However, that doesn't mean that we can't do small engagements."
</p><p>Tikba says, "Oh! The refuge from combat thing actually reminded me of a thing I realized a long time ago. I wanted to have Tikba be eligible for citizenship in Cysaegir for RP reasons. But it's pretty difficult to get citizenship in Cysaegir because there's no Adventurer's Guild."
</p><p>Tikba says, "I don't have a solution to that but it is a thing I noticed."
</p><p>You say, "I only mention this because Grawood would be one of those big commmitments."
</p><p>Rohese softly assures, "The last thing any of us want to do is burn you all out."
</p><p>Speaking to you, Oishian says, "The dragonfly festival was too short, but thoroughly fun."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "The pop up player markets have been a pretty big smash."
</p><p>Zarana says, "Well, I'm not asking for a re-creation of Grawood exactly, but more along the lines of the informal RP gathering ideas asked for."
</p><p>Xynwen says, "You can see some of the games from Grawood at your friendly CHE events."
</p><p>Jaysehn says, "We just needed suitable rooms for it."
</p><p>Nylyn exclaims, "Definitely don't want to stress the GMs!"
</p><p>You say, "No worries, I just wanted to explain."
</p><p>Nylyn says, "But those pop-up farmers markets have been great, like Jaysehn says."
</p><p>Speaking to Tikba, Oishian says, "That thought crossed my mind, as well. We need an AG."
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "I can definitely see us co-ordinating a market here."
</p><p>Zarana says, "I was just throwing out a sugestion that could drive additional traffic, since most other towns do have a combat focus and may be too busy to tackle the more relaxing activities."
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "If there was the player traffic."
</p><p>Zarana says, "Suggestion."
</p><p>Rohese softly exclaims, "Which I hope there will be!"
</p><p>Zarana says, "If it's scheduled I would come."
</p><p>Speaking to Rohese, Nylyn exclaims, "We just have to MAKE the traffic!"
</p><p>Tikba says, "I didn't want to say 'make an AG' because there isn't very much hunting near Cysaegir so we would be asking for like six hunting areas haha."
</p><p>Speaking softly to Nylyn, Rohese exclaims, "We do!"
</p><p>Tikba says, "But maybe! I don't know if there would be an easier way."
</p><p>Casil says, "I know the TV market in November saw a ton of out of town traffic, so I trust y'all would have plenty of traffic if you had a scheduled player market you ran here."
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "I'll add that to MY list then."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "These have all been really great ideas, and while I don't want to promise certain things will happen, I'm taking note and looking into it."
</p><p>Nylyn says, "I definitely traveled wherever I needed to to get to those markets."
</p><p>Speaking to Xeraphina, Oishian exclaims, "Welcome, by the way!"
</p><p>Zarana says, "I also love garden parties and such."
</p><p>Rohese softly says, "Anything that brings people east over the mountains is ...."
</p><p>Speaking to Xeraphina, Nylyn exclaims, "You're already doing great!"
</p><p>Speaking to Oishian, Xeraphina exclaims, "Thank you!"
</p><p>Speaking to Rohese, Jaysehn says, "I'm making scones. Badly. Just fyi."
</p><p>Tikba says, "I am just happy to hear that you want things that I want too, so I am happy to wait and see."
</p><p>Nylyn says, "Just want to reiterate, my expectations are totally tempered, I'm just very excited."
</p><p>Xeraphina says, "Okay, I think I can safely conclude this meeting.  We should have a log up at some point soonish."
