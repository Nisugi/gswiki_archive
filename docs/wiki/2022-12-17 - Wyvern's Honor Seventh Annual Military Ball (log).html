The deep blue silk overhead has been painted to resemble the night sky, complete with moons.  Bronze lanterns dangle from the tent posts, creating pools of soft, flickering light.  Gold and blue velvet cushions heaped in the corners provide quiet places to rest.  You also see a gilt-necked crimson bottle of wine incised with a gold wyvern, a frosted blue glass bottle, a squat dark brown bottle, a painted vineyard-motif bottle and a bright copper cart with some stuff on it.
Also here: First Legionnaire Laermeluion, Lady Uniana, Lord Teveriel, Lady in Waiting Lynaera, Katness, Mistress Lithyia, Jiarine, Squire Legionnaire Gudbrand, Great Lady Traiva, Squire Legionnaire Tylanthriel, Legionnaire Esana, Grand Lady Opalina, Legionnaire Agathilea, Alenwyn, Squire Legionnaire Krystalena, Orssus, Grand Lord Falvicar, Lady Shyair

Speaking to herself, Fyg says, "Must put those elsewhere."

Shyair giggles.

(Uniana remains arm-in-arm with Teveriel, taking a slow appraisal of the crowd with a blithe expression.)

High Legionnaire Aureliano just arrived.

Speaking to Aureliano, Krystalena says, "Good eve, Sir."

Tylanthriel grins at Agathilea.

Speaking curiously to Shyair, Traiva asks, "How does that fare here?"

Traiva asks, "Or do you mean Dreaven's games?"

Speaking to Aureliano, Tylanthriel says, "Good evening sir."

Traiva appears to be trying hard not to grin.

With faint whispers like the dying of embers in a forgotten hearth, the flames recede into the fabric of Fyg's pink velvet wrap, leaving naught behind but the subtlest ghost of smoke in the air.

Aureliano nods in greeting at Esana.

Speaking warmly to Aureliano, Agathilea says, "Good evening, Sir."

Laermeluion nods to Aureliano in greeting.

Speaking quietly to Traiva, Shyair says, "Last night at another party we did that I ad my turn which... well... almost got me a coin from everyone."

Speaking to Laermeluion, Agathilea says, "And good evening to you, Sir."

Traiva raises an eyebrow in Shyair's direction.

You turn your thoughts inward, observing your opinion on society and your place within it.

Shyair quietly says, "I won't embarrass anyone by saying what that was."

Feeling slightly flustered, you begin to subconsciously twist a strand of champagne-hued hair around your haircomb.  Realizing what you're doing, you quickly lower your hand and adopt a more composed demeanor to face to the world.

Opalina curtsies to Aureliano.

(Alenwyn raises a hand slightly from her side and gives Aureliano a small, subtle wave in greeting.)

Krystalena sways to and fro as she dances.

Lithyia says, "Last night was...interesting."

Katness takes a drink from her cherry lemonade.

Laermeluion nods to Agathilea in greeting.

Traiva shows Uniana a knotwork and dragonfly tattoo.

Speaking in Elven, Aureliano politely asks, "Lord and Lady Anduin, I am glad to see you could both make it." He offers Teverial and Uniana a polite half bow as he approaches them. "How have you both been?"

Speaking in Elven to Gudbrand, Agathilea says, "Certainly."

Uniana fans herself lightly with her crimson silk fan, the small bladepoints within glittering like a trail of twinkling stardust over her skin as she takes on a subtly studious expression.

Gudbrand chuckles.

Lithyia takes a bite of her dipped blueberries.

Speaking quietly to Traiva, Shyair says, "THank you, my friend made them for me,"

Orssus twirls Krystalena gracefully across the dance floor.

Agathilea extends her left arm over her head and dips forward, her other arm arced behind herself.  As she pirouettes, the hem of her crimson silk gown floats up airly, briefly veiling her in a drape of epaulette-set plumage before descending in a slow spiral.

Aureliano raises an eyebrow in Uniana's direction.

Agathilea smiles at Gudbrand.

Lithyia says, "I put together a special box for someone to give them tomorrow."

Speaking to Traiva, Aphaedra says, "I have one of those as well. I think they expect black leather skirts with high slits so sometimes you have to show up in a gown."

<span style="color:red">Speaking delightedly to Qalinor, Agathilea exclaims, "Of course!" </span>

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Agathilea, Qalinor says, "Though this clumsy old soldier may step on a toe or two." </span>

Perigourd chuckles.

<span style="color:red">Qalinor winks at Agathilea. </span>

As the tune finishes, the gathered listeners applaud gently.

Agathilea says, "And I was worried about injuring my Sovereign."

Shyair quietly says, "The times he's had to drag my dead body...."

<span style="color:red">Agathilea grins at Qalinor. </span>

Speaking to Perigourd, Traiva says, "I find it best to be in a skirt that allows easy movement. And perhaps a hidden blade."

Speaking to Lithyia, Perigourd muses, "I expect one could do so in a kilt as well."

Speaking to Lithyia, Aphaedra says, "I am sure my husband would agree with you there."

Traiva calmly flutters her wings to an unheard rhythm.

Lithyia grins at Aphaedra.

Perigourd nods in agreement at Traiva.

Lithyia says, "I have never worn a kilt."

Krystalena smiles at Agathilea.

Lithyia says, "But a man in a kilt...that is...nice."

Lithyia nods.

Aphaedra nods at Lithyia.

Lithyia nods at Aphaedra.

Speaking to Lithyia, Aphaedra says, "I knew we were a true meeting of minds."

You hear very soft footsteps.

Lithyia laughs at Aphaedra!

Falvicar nuzzles his face against Opalina's.

<span style="color:red">Qalinor leads Agathilea onto the dance floor, pulling her into a close, yet formal, embrace. </span>

(Tylanthriel leads Esana off the dance floor and bows towards her once more.)

The soft melodies of a silver-stringed harp and an alto recorder fill the evening air as the musicians begin a song echoing the soft breezes of spring.

Speaking sheepishly to Shyair, Traiva says, "Do not recall that I caught your name, as much as I have enjoyed our banter."

Opalina steals a kiss from Falvicar as they sway across the dance floor.

Speaking amusedly to Traiva, Vyctus says, "I don't think you are supposed to mention hidden blades in the presence of the King..."

Perigourd brings the dark maoral pipe to his lips and inhales deeply of its currant-scent, then abruptly exhales some dark streams of smoke from his nose.

Agathilea blushes a nice shade of pink.

Tylanthriel slowly empties his lungs.

Speaking to Shyair, Traiva introduces, "I am Traiva."

Agathilea tilts her head up.

Speaking quietly to Traiva, Shyair says, "I am Shyair Lostborn, Locksmith in training."

Aureliano glances between Vyctus and Traiva.

Traiva smiles at Shyair.

<span style="color:red">Agathilea smiles at Qalinor. </span>

Shyair curtsies to Traiva.

Speaking to Shyair, Traiva says, "A pleasure."

Dallanoth chuckles.

Vyctus says, "Granted, there are enough soldiers here... I don't think it would do much."

Traiva curtsies gracefully to Shyair.

Falvicar ponders.

(Teveriel and Uniana glide across the dance floor, each of their forms orbiting the other until they seem nearly as entwined as the briars they both wear as part of their ensembles.)

Shyair quietly says, "At least I don't have dillusions of what I am."

Falvicar nuzzles his face against Opalina's.

Lithyia asks, "Shyair, you were outside earlier when I was plucking all the mistletoe off that wreath, yes?"

The musicians end on a soft and gentle note.

Shyair nods at Lithyia.

Lithyia giggles.

Lithyia grins.

You say, "There was this one year..."

Opalina holds Falvicar close in her arms as they dance.

Speaking to Vyctus, Traiva says, "If you can think of where I could put a blade in this gown, do tell."

You quickly say, "Nevermind."

Lithyia asks, "Did you get your fill of the candy canes?"

Lithyia raises an eyebrow in Shyair's direction.

Lithyia laughs at Traiva!

Dallanoth examines Traiva closely, sizing her up and taking note of all the details.

Alenwyn softly giggles.

Shyair quietly says, "No."

Uniana cheerfully comments, "I swear that wreath is the biggest scandal of the season."

Agathilea extends her left arm over her head and dips forward, her other arm arced behind herself.  As she pirouettes, the hem of her crimson silk gown floats up airly, briefly veiling her in a drape of epaulette-set plumage before descending in a slow spiral.

Falvicar holds Opalina close in his arms as they dance.

Dallanoth rubs his chin thoughtfully.

<span style="color:red">Agathilea smiles at Qalinor. </span>

Traiva giggles at Uniana.

Perigourd takes a moment to observe Traiva.

Lithyia says, "The wreath is the most helpful thing ever..or so I do hope it will be."

Shyair quietly says, "So I want to know...."

<span style="color:red">Qalinor steps in two, then three, then two, then twirl as Agathilea effortlessly matches each step. </span>

Lithyia says, "It certainly cannot make things worse."

The musicians strike up an old romantic ballad.

Shyair quietly says, "How is a parasitic poisonous plant the symbol of kissing."

Perigourd nods thoughtfully.

Laermeluion smiles.

Lithyia says, "I do not think that deeply about it."

Vyctus chuckles.

Lithyia grins at Shyair.

Orssus grins at Krystalena.

Shyair ponders.

Traiva gives a sidelong glance at Dallanoth.

Traiva picks idly at an off-the-shoulder claret velvet gown beaded with golden seed pearls.

Speaking to Shyair, Aphaedra asks, "You have never kissed someone poisonous even though you knew it was a bad idea?"

Dallanoth smiles at Traiva.

Perigourd puffs rapidly on his dark maoral pipe, some dark wisps of fragrant currant-scented smoke dancing about him.

Aphaedra grins at Shyair.

<span style="color:red">Qalinor drops Agathilea into a low dip, before pulling her upright into a close, yet formal, embrace once more. </span>

You think to yourself, "It would be rather amusing for him to ask Alenwyn to dance."

Traiva begins chortling at Aphaedra.

You rub your chin thoughtfully.

Lithyia laughs at Aphaedra!

Speaking quietly to Aphaedra, Shyair says, "No."

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

<span style="color:red">Speaking surprisedly to Qalinor, Agathilea says, "Feels like we left the ground." </span>

Lithyia says, "I dont recommend it, even though I continue to repeat the same mistakes."

Lithyia laughs!

Lithyia nods at Shyair.

Speaking to Shyair, Aphaedra says, "You really must. It is a life experience."

Speaking lightly to Aphaedra, Traiva asks, "That is rather a fun sort of danger, no?"

Agathilea glances down.

Shyair quietly says, "I don't kiss."

Falvicar grins impishly at Opalina.

Aphaedra nods at Shyair.

<span style="color:red">Agathilea blushes a pink shade at Qalinor. </span>

Lithyia blinks.

<span style="color:red">Qalinor steps in two, then three, then two, then twirl as Agathilea embraces the dance, embellishing perfectly with her own flourishes. </span>

Shyair quietly says, "Or any of that.... stuff."

Dallanoth mutters she-bites.

Lithyia says, "Oh."

Speaking to Shyair, Aphaedra exclaims, "Then by all means, no poisonous kisses for you!"

Opalina tilts her head and tosses an inviting wink in Falvicar's direction.

Lithyia agrees with Aphaedra.

Shyair ponders.

(Uniana absently traces over the tines along Teveriel's collar before their movements slow and take a few measured steps back from each other.)

(Aphaedra gnashes her teeth at Dallanoth with a chuckle.)

Perigourd puffs rapidly on his dark maoral pipe, some dark wisps of fragrant currant-scented smoke dancing about him.

Speaking to Dallanoth, Aphaedra says, "I wasn't sure which of us you meant."

Gentle melodies flow forth from the musicians' instruments.

Speaking curiously to Opalina, Aureliano asks, "Are you and your husband staying long, or just visiting for the evening?"

Shyair quietly says, "I have threatened Dezter with a carrot."

Uniana sinks down in a deep curtsy before Teveriel, her lashes lowered.

Aphaedra laughs at Shyair!

Lithyia asks, "A carrot?"

Speaking softly to Dallanoth, Traiva says, "I hope you do not mind my admiration of your boots. The heels are quite stunning."

Speaking to Aphaedra, Dallanoth says, "Not you."

Speaking to Shyair, Aphaedra says, "You know... I do not believe my brother eats vegetables."

<span style="color:red">Agathilea smiles at Qalinor. </span>

Shyair quietly says, "He ate his veggies.... then went and died and sank his boat."

Shyair shakes her head.

Speaking to Shyair, Aphaedra says, "A good threat."

Gudbrand returns to normal color.

Dallanoth smiles at Traiva.

Teveriel smiles almost wistfully as he and Uniana end their dance, returning her curtsy with a courtly bow.

Speaking quietly to Aureliano, Opalina says, "We were visiting for the evening."

Speaking reverently to Teveriel, Uniana says, "Thank you."

Vyctus grins at Corlyne.

Tylanthriel grins at Esana.

Uniana tilts her head up.

Corlyne chuckles.

Esana nods in agreement.

Speaking to Traiva, Dallanoth asks, "Thank you, i am sure you know of Akenna?"

Traiva smiles brightly.

(Falvicar raises Opalina up suddenly, and he carefully moves in a circle while holding her, before bringing her down slowly.. ending it in a dip down to the floor before pulling her back into his arms.)

Speaking quietly to Aureliano, Opalina says, "But we are not in a rush."

The music seems to wind on forever, bringing old memories and thoughts long forgotten to the surface of your mind.

<span style="color:red">Qalinor lifts Agathilea high above his head as he turns slowly once, twice, then one final time as he lowers Agathilea into a close, yet formal embrace once more. </span>

Lithyia asks, "Who doesnt know of Akenna?"

Speaking tenderly to Uniana, Teveriel responds, "Always."

Lithyia laughs!

Uniana's fingers trace aimless designs over the aqilorn of her gown.

Agathilea breathlessly exclaims, "Oh!"

Opalina releases a tiny squeak of surprise!

<span style="color:red">Agathilea smiles at Qalinor. </span>

Shyair quietly asks, "Who's Akenna?"

Traiva says, "You missed the mention earlier that her marriage is my fault."

Agathilea chuckles.

Speaking sincerely to Opalina, Aureliano asks, "I am sorry to hear that. Could I convince you to stay the evening as a guest and join with us tomorrow for food?"

<span style="color:red">Aphaedra applauds Qalinor. </span>

Dallanoth tries fruitlessly to rub off some of the blood from his boots.

Speaking to Shyair, Traiva says, "Akenna is Jaysehn's, the Commodore's, wife, and a master cordwainer."

Lithyia says, "Akenna makes fabulous footwear."

<span style="color:red">Qalinor steps back from Agathilea and bows deeply at the waist before leading her off the dance floor. </span>

Shyair quietly asks, "Cord....wainer?"

<span style="color:red">Agathilea drops smoothly into a deep curtsy before Qalinor, sweeping her arms grandly to her sides. </span>

A strolling band of musicians begins a sprightly dance tune.

Lithyia says, "Shoemaker."

Shyair squints.

Lithyia nods at Shyair.

Shyair quietly exclaims, "Oh!"

Speaking to Shyair, Traiva says, "She designs footwear, besides making it."

Speaking quietly to Falvicar, Opalina asks, "Would you like to stay My darling?"

Lithyia says, "They fit your feet perfectly.  Her shoes are perfection."

Shyair quietly says, "I don't have the patienced or funds for special stuff."

(Uniana leads Teveriel towards Vyctus and Corlyne.)

Shyair quietly says, "My shoe fits perfectly."

Traiva bashfully says, "I am attempting to follow in her footsteps, so to speak."

Lithyia says, "You will get there."

Lithyia nods at Traiva.

Shyair shows Traiva her blue silk slippers.

Vyctus smiles at Uniana.

The music seems to wind on forever, bringing old memories and thoughts long forgotten to the surface of your mind.

Gudbrand seems a bit less imposing.

(Traiva lifts her skirts slightly to show off her shoes.)

Speaking to Shyair, Aphaedra says, "That makes me so sad. I have almost as many pairs of shoes as I have glowns."

Vyctus bows deeply at the waist, honoring Uniana.

Speaking to Lithyia, Traiva says, "It is a fair enough attempt."

Lithyia nods at Aphaedra.

<span style="color:red">Speaking softly to Qalinor, Agathilea compliments, "A lovely dance sir.  Nice moves." </span>

Lithyia nods at Traiva.

<span style="color:red">Agathilea smiles at Qalinor. </span>

Shyair quietly says, "This is my red spidersilk gown dyed blue."

Lithyia agrees with Traiva.

A single feather slips from Esana's white-feathered wings and floats gently on an unfelt breeze, dissipating into a fine silver mist just before reaching the floor.

Shyair slips a pair of astonishing blue silk slippers studded with onyx scarabs onto her feet.  They appear to fit perfectly.

Vyctus pleasantly says, "Cousins, a pleasure to have your company."

Traiva laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement from Shyair.

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Agathilea, Qalinor says, "It's always because of my partner." </span>

Agathilea blushes a pink hue to the tips of her ears.

Shyair quietly says, "I suddenly feel like less of a woman but my locker is full."

Agathilea inclines her head.

Speaking to Shyair, Traiva says, "My seamstress would love to work for you. Your wardrobe must be much easier to attend than mine."

Aphaedra looks over at Shyair and shakes her head.

A strolling band of musicians begins a sprightly dance tune.

Speaking in Elven to Opalina, Falvicar says, "I'm not against my Love, though I'd hope we'd head back home afterward.  I still have much work to do with my katana and will be recovered enough to continue to work on it tomorrow as it were."

Dallanoth says, "I just realized i am woefully under dressed."

Speaking casually to Vyctus, Teveriel says, "Hello again, Lord Scio; Lady Feynde."

Hanging on securely with three paws, the sewer rat on Dallanoth's shoulder licks its fourth paw and spends several seconds carefully smoothing out the fur covering its lower back and one leg.

Shyair grins at Dallanoth.

Shyair quietly says, "Nah."

Perigourd looks over at Dallanoth and shakes his head.

Speaking to Shyair, Aphaedra says, "You just have more money than all of us, I bet."

Speaking lightly to Vyctus, Teveriel asks, "Staying out of 'trouble'?"

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Qalinor, Aphaedra asks, "My dear king, do you have an open dance card?" </span>

Speaking in Elven to Opalina, Falvicar says, "In four or five days, I should have enough to strength to put the fourth cast of sanctification upon it."

Speaking to Teveriel, Vyctus says, "With Corlyne here? I mean, I'm doing my best."

As the tune finishes, the gathered listeners applaud gently.

Speaking to Corlyne, Uniana says, "Have you plans for the Feast of the Immortals? We have a rather large party heading to Ardenai under Celothor's invitation and to see my cousin Lear for their Winternight celebration. You would be a most welcome addition."

Lithyia gawks at Aphaedra.

Agathilea glances at Krystalena.

Shyair quietly says, "I need to learn new dance steps."

Agathilea blushes a nice shade of pink.

Speaking earnestly to Dallanoth, Traiva explains, "Because you clearly have a joy for life. And recognize that it is not worth doing things half-heartedly."

Agathilea tilts her head down.

Aphaedra giggles.

Perigourd looks thoughtfully at Uniana.

Shyair quietly says, "I don't think swep reps count."

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Qalinor, Aphaedra says, "My apologies, my king. I have very little filter between my mind and my mouth." </span>

Vyctus leans back a bit and folds his arms behind his head.

Lithyia begins chuckling at Aphaedra!

Speaking jokingly to Uniana, Corlyne asks, "Are you inquiring so someone can keep an eye out on your other cousin?"

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

Traiva blinks.

Opalina takes a drink from her thick warm eggnog.

Traiva smiles at Dallanoth.

Nosing about inside Dallanoth's collar, the sewer rat eventually sits up with a dried-up dropping clutched in its jaws.  Letting the discovery fall to the ground, the sewer rat chitters at Dallanoth, obviously annoyed at his lack of hygiene.

Falvicar wiggles his ears.

Falvicar takes a drink from his thick warm eggnog.

Speaking to Dallanoth, Traiva says, "Thank you."

Speaking to Traiva, Dallanoth says, "Welcome."

(Agathilea watches her Sovereign and her High Legionnaire intently, noting the expertise of footwork and strength in each move.)

Uniana sways, causing the aqilorn of her gown's long skirts to swish back and forth.

Falvicar glances at Opalina and quirks an eyebrow in her direction.

Falvicar rubs his chin thoughtfully.

(Aphaedra whispers loudly to Agathilea, "Do you think they practiced?")

(Agathilea lightly taps her foot in time to the beat.)

A strolling band of musicians begins a sprightly dance tune.

Speaking to Teveriel, Vyctus says, "Depends on the dance, I don't know the Vaalorian dances well, far more orderly and less chaotic than I tend to be."

Speaking to Teveriel, Corlyne whispers aloud, "The occasional flailing of arms."

Shyair quietly says, "Just got to watch and flow with the music to get the dances."

Speaking quietly to Vyctus, Uniana challenges, "He said a *fine* swordsman."

Speaking to Traiva, Agathilea says, "It does.  Especially for those who fight with less magic or no magic."

Speaking to Corlyne, Vyctus asks, "Occassional?"

Traiva nods slowly at Agathilea.

Speaking to Uniana, Vyctus says, "I'm fine."

Vyctus grins at Uniana.

Speaking to Traiva, Agathilea says, "There is strength in physical moves."

Speaking to Uniana, Dallanoth says, "Well that counts me out also."

Speaking to Uniana, Vyctus says, "He didn't say a good swordsman."

Agathilea smiles at Traiva.

Shyair snickers.

Uniana gazes heavenward.

As the tune finishes, the gathered listeners applaud gently.

Teveriel dismisses, "Mm, aesthetic differences aside--" He laughs quietly at Uniana's comment, briefly interrupting his train of thought. He takes a moment to recover. "--at any rate, footwork is key."

Perigourd puffs rapidly on his dark maoral pipe, some dark wisps of fragrant currant-scented smoke dancing about him.

<span style="color:red">Qalinor creates a strong base as Aureliano climbs atop him, eventually standing on the King's shoulders.  with a loud grunt, they bring their fists to their chests and come to a complete stop. </span>

Speaking softly to Agathilea, Traiva says, "That there is. It reminds me of the dances I taught to an associate of mine."

Speaking quietly to Dallanoth, Shyair says, "But as the grandmaster you can literally sweep just about anyone off their feet."

Speaking to Traiva, Agathilea says, "Empaths excel at such."

You tilt your head up.

Agathilea applauds Aureliano.

Opalina giggles to herself.

Aureliano smiles and returns the forearm bash, "It must be.. a century at least since I have done that, and the alcohol I drank then should have precluded me from remembering."

Speaking softly to Agathilea, Traiva says, "It is very close to what I was thinking. Perhaps I shall work something similar for the Carnivale Concert."

Laermeluion applauds.

Aureliano begins chuckling at Orssus!

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Aureliano, Qalinor says, "I'm not sure I've ever done that without at least a couple ales in me." </span>

Opalina sways back and forth.

Agathilea comments, "Fine footwork by my Sovereign likely has purged my memory."

(Traiva places her hand over her heart, an overly dramatic wounded expression crossing her face.)

<span style="color:red">Agathilea glances at Qalinor. </span>

Speaking to Aureliano, Perigourd says, "Easy enough to correct the latter part."

Perigourd nods at Aureliano.

Dallanoth blinks.

Perigourd brings the dark maoral pipe to his lips and inhales deeply of its currant-scent, then abruptly exhales some dark streams of smoke from his nose.

The soft melodies of a silver-stringed harp and an alto recorder fill the evening air as the musicians begin a song echoing the soft breezes of spring.

Speaking to Traiva, Agathilea exclaims, "Oh, I am sorry!  I shall remedy this as soon as I can!"

Speaking to Agathilea, Traiva says, "Revelia Carnivale has been the last two years in Koaratos. The Concert is, well, my pet project, after Bardfest ended."

Teveriel quips, "This beer is especially pungent, you will be well on your way after four or so."

Aureliano smirks at Teveriel.

Shyair picks up a squat dark brown bottle.

Speaking quietly to Corlyne, Vyctus says, "I hope you never expect me to remember how to do a dance in unison..."

Speaking to Aureliano, Traiva says, "You should work - soberly - with other Legionnaires for a much grander version. That was very well done."

Krystalena giggles.

Speaking to Vyctus, Corlyne says, "You'll have to learn how to spar eventually, it's similar movement."

Shyair drops a squat dark brown bottle.

Speaking to Traiva, Agathilea says, "I see.  I have been bound to my work in the Legion up until this year when I achieved the first of my goals.  I shall make time to attend."

(Uniana takes a long drink of her rose-infused champagne, taking several sips sequentially.)

Speaking to Aureliano, Aphaedra says, "I cannot hope to follow up a king, but I'd like the next dance regardless."

Speaking to Corlyne, Vyctus says, "I mean, I've sparred before... I just get cut a lot."

Aphaedra takes a drink from her rose-infused champagne.

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Speaking to Vyctus, Corlyne says, "I apologized and purchased the herbs."

Corlyne grins at Vyctus.

Traiva sheepishly says, "Not that I know a thing about their normal training.."

<span style="color:red">Speaking to Qalinor, Krystalena exclaims, "Thank you for the new memory.  That was great!" </span>

Aphaedra dances lightly across the dance floor with Aureliano.

Perigourd shakes his dark maoral pipe a bit, and the glowing embers within quickly fade and go out.

Perigourd tucks a robust dark maoral pipe into a raw leather bag cinched with braided maoral roots inside of his green suede cloak.

Agathilea flashes a wide grin at Traiva.

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Shyair quietly says, "Good to see you having a snack."

Falvicar nods once.

Shyair nods at Dallanoth.

Speaking softly to Dallanoth, Traiva asks, "I do not see the regalia many of the others wear. Are you not a Legionaire?"

Dallanoth seems a bit less imposing.

Dallanoth returns to normal color.

The air about Dallanoth stops shimmering.

Dallanoth seems to lose some dexterity.

Dallanoth becomes solid again.

Dallanoth takes a deep breath, blinking a couple of times before resuming a calm expression.

A series of violet lines suddenly appears on Dallanoth's face, quickly racing towards the center of his forehead before detaching and dissipating in the air.

Shyair quietly says, "I want a chocolae shop here though."

Agathilea slides her hand beneath the epaulette-set plumage overlay on her crimson silk gown, causing the fabric to billow around her briefly before it once again veils her form.

Speaking to Aureliano, Aphaedra says, "I just watched you and our king destroy the dance floor. I do not think you can claim rust anymore."

Speaking to Shyair, Dallanoth says, "Every once in a while i get a bit of a sweet tooth."

Agathilea begins chuckling at Aphaedra!

<span style="color:red">Qalinor says, "Thank you all for coming tonight and showing support in honor of all of those who have taken up arms to defend our home, citizen, resident, or guest.  It has not gone unnoticed." </span>

Agathilea nods in agreement.

[Midnight Blue Tent]

The deep blue silk overhead has been painted to resemble the night sky, complete with moons.  Bronze lanterns dangle from the tent posts, creating pools of soft, flickering light.  Gold and blue velvet cushions heaped in the corners provide quiet places to rest.  You also see a squat dark brown bottle, a gilt-necked crimson bottle of wine incised with a gold wyvern, a painted vineyard-motif bottle and a bright copper cart with some stuff on it.

Also here: Master Dallanoth, Lady Shyair, First Legionnaire Laermeluion, Legionnaire Agathilea, Lady Corlyne, Perigourd, Lord Vyctus, Lady Uniana, Lord Teveriel, Mistress Lithyia, Great Lady Traiva, Squire Legionnaire Tylanthriel, Legionnaire Esana, Grand Lady Opalina, Alenwyn, Squire Legionnaire Krystalena, Orssus, Grand Lord Falvicar
