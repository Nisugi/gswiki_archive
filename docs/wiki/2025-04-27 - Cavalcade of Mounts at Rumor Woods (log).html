Join the parade and then the competition for a raffle and prizes, including mounts ranging from common to rare!"

You reach inside one of the containers hanging from the steel and hide harness and grab the sable standard.

&gt;l at wastes
You see a colossal gold wastesdragon, whom you have named "Gulveig."
His wedge-shaped head is masked in black, with tiny pupilless burnished gold eyes peering out from beneath low ridges.  Breaking up the darkness, a daubed pattern of gold scales begins just past his brow and extends all the way to the tip of his tail.  With a thick-scaled hide eye-catching in both contrast and depth of color, his form is stout, his body and tail thick, and his neck and legs short.
He is wearing a twisted black rope harness, a copper-traced pectoral of overlapping faenor leaves, a soft knitted hunter green and cobalt blue tartan blanket and a selshis skin nakaten with gold cantle spikes.


You are currently riding a colossal gold wastesdragon.


[Rumor Woods, Junction]
Multiple game trails converge on this section of track, their winding tracks sending them deeper into the western and northern confines of the flame-topped aspen grove.  Westerly pathways flank the edges of an enormous jousting field surrounded by high viewing stands topped with colorful pennants.  The ringing sound of anvil strikes echoes from the northeast and is punctuated by the soft sound of neighing from the southeast.  A large wooden sign post laden with signs offers information on the area.  You also see the Roelaren disk, a dark oak and steel wagon, a dwarven blacksmith assistant, a freshly cut stump with a Rumor Woods map on it and an old has-been jouster.
Also here: Brother-in-arms Perigourd, Sister-in-Arms Roelaren who is sitting, Four Winds Resident Brimzstone
Obvious paths: north, northeast, southeast, southwest, west, northwest


Speaking to Riend, Arelder says, "I have been practicing, but as I told Sister Ifanna earlier, I am a bit uncertain I could compete against such talent."
Ifanna leans forward in her saddle and rubs the side of her horse's neck, then pats her gently while quietly uttering several words of encouragement.
Arelder nods to you in greeting.
Regwen turns toward you and renders you a sharp hand salute.


(Bristenn muffles something encouraging within the depths of his steel heaume.)


Arelder leans forward in his wide saddle, and, using the stirrups as leverage to lift himself farther up, he gives his white stallion a little rub between his ears.  Once he sits back down, he ensures his feet are properly angled in the stirrups, then relaxes his legs.

You turn toward Jarnsaixa and render a sharp salute with your sable standard.

 
You turn toward Odelgarde and render a sharp salute with your sable standard.

You see Jarnsaixa Vargrdoittr the Knight Bachelorette.
She appears to be a Giantman of the Grishknel Clan.
She is tall and has lean, well-muscled form.  She appears to be mature.  She has round, slightly hooded and green-tinted hazel eyes and bronze skin.  She has waist-length, smooth sun-lightened, chocolate brown hair twisted into a multitude of warbraids, alternating thin and thick as they hug her skull with each sporadically banded in gold-wired coils.  She has a muscled face, a broken nose and a stern countenance.  An angry, ragged scar trails down her left arm starting at her shoulder and ending at her wrist.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing a pair of fleece-lined kidskin gloves, a decorative gold aventail incised with symbols of rank and office, a rugged grizzly bear pelt throat-clasped in a pennanular brooch, a pair of golvern spurs, and a cross-body swan tartan plaid over a suit of gold-edged full plate of damascened krodera.


At Oxhammer's command, a coal black sai'ri monster's lowers himself until his belly brushes the ground and he dips his wedge-shaped head.  Oxhammer pulls his double rope harness over the sai'ri monster's snout and hoists himself up onto the beast's back to sit astride just behind his shoulders.  He tugs firmly against the harness and appears confident with its placement.
 
Speaking to Jarnsaixa, Perigourd says, "We would be honored to have you in parade with us."


Jarnsaixa smiles.
 
Jarnsaixa nods.
S 
Jarnsaixa chuckles.
Bristenn wryly adds, "What's a tourney without a parade?"

 
Everall affixes his reins to his white horse's bit, and with a firm push off the ground, he swings astride him and settles into a black kidskin-seated saddle with phoenix-etched stirrups.
 
Jastalyn affixes her reins to her rose-sheened charger's bit, and with a firm push off the ground, she swings astride her and settles into a light beige saddle burned with an eight-pointed star.


Missoni affixes her reins to a white unicorn's bit, and with a firm push off the ground, she swings astride the unicorn and settles onto her bare back.

Jarnsaixa says, "She and Athalia have been trying to convince me to be team Bee..."
 
Speaking to Jarnsaixa, Perigourd says, "The only team to bee."
 
Jarnsaixa says, "I have had to remind her that I'm Kindred."
 
Giogionni says, "That sounds un-bear-able."
Jarnsaixa chuckles.
 
Cryheart grins at Jarnsaixa.
Mourdeyan grins at Jarnsaixa.
 
Speaking in Giantman to Jarnsaixa, you say, "Bears like honey."

Punching his toe into a niche near a reticulated rhinoceros beetle's thorax, Perigourd swings his leg over the top and settles on the soft webbing that serves as a joint between the head and thorax.


Speaking amusedly to you, Jarnsaixa says, "Not you, too."

 
Speaking to Jarnsaixa, you say, "Oh aye."
 
Jarnsaixa chuckles.

Speaking to Jarnsaixa, Delindra asks, "Did he just tell a pun in kindred?"
 
Jarnsaixa grins at Delindra.

Yukito glances at a white bear.

 
You glance skeptically at Jarnsaixa.
 
&lt;&lt;Edited so Delindra will never know&gt;&gt;


Kothos bows to Bristenn.
 
Speaking to Jarnsaixa, you say, "Oh, worth noting. Delindra here is our newest member."


Delindra smiles.
Jarnsaixa smiles.
 
Jarnsaixa balls her hand into a fist and pounds it against a knotwork bronze brooch worn at her shoulder.  Once, twice, and three times she strikes as a fierce look of determination settles about her.

Cryheart says, "My formor squire."
 
Cryheart smiles at Jarnsaixa.
Jarnsaixa bows to Delindra.
Delindra bows to Jarnsaixa.
 
You nod approvingly at Delindra.

Poised atop her white horse, Ifanna carefully rests her fingers atop the upright pommel of the horse's lion-emblazoned saddle with, seemingly, a feather-light touch.
Cryheart says, "She was an excellent squire."
 
Speaking to Cryheart, Jarnsaixa says, "I can hear in your voice the pride."

Cryheart says, "Aye, she made me proud."
Delindra affectedly says, "And a wonderful Mentor I had as well."

 
[General] You exclaim, "Final call to join the cavalcade. We are gathering at the jouster in rumor woods. The competition will begin after the parade!"
 
Tebon leans forward and rests against a grey destrier's neck.
 

Delindra affectionately adds, "He did an exceptional job working wiht a Cholenite protege."


 
Speaking to Delindra, you say, "We all face challenges."


Perigourd recites:
    "Greetings all, the Orders of the Silver Gryphon and the Azure Sun welcome you to the Second Annual Cavalcade of Mounts!"


Perigourd recites:
    "In a moment we will mount our steeds and parade across the lists to the Roar of the Stars to enjoy an evening of equestrian excellence in which we encourage you all to raise your standards, crests, and calls of fealty!"

 
Jastalyn softly says, "Only one Rosie."
 
Jastalyn rubs a rose-sheened charger.
&gt; 
Perigourd recites:
    "We shall begin the parade on upon the hornblast and the entourage will cavort slowly to the bonfire"


Raelee affixes her reins to her chestnut mare's bit, and with a firm push off the ground, she swings astride her and settles into a bronze-fit walnut leather saddle.
 
 
Kothos affixes his reins to a black unicorn's bit, and with a firm push off the ground, he swings astride the unicorn and settles into a scarlet jackdaw-stamped saddle.

 
Perigourd lifts his pale golden warhorn to his lips and gives a mighty blow, loosing a low resounding blast from the warhorn!


Missoni lets out a cheer!
Goldstr waves his leather reins through the air and a white horse arrives.

Extending his front leg forward in a graceful motion, the hart lowers himself slightly, allowing Brigit to fasten a white lamb's wool halter strap stitched with emerald threading onto his neck.  With a quick motion, she throws one leg across his back as he straightens, and Brigit settles into a comfortable position astride his back.

 
Perigourd exclaims, "Onward!"

 
Brother-in-arms Perigourd rides southeast on a mechanized rhinoceros beetle, followed by his group.


You wear a sable standard displaying an argent tri-winged charge, securing it to show over your shoulder.
 
Cryheart waves his black banner around enthusiastically, whipping it back and forth through the air.
  
 
Quickly raising the horn to your lips, you seal your mouth tightly around the mouthpiece and blow into it, trumpeting a piercing alarm which echoes through the surrounding area.
 
You raise your sable standard high into the air for all to see.
 
  
Perigourd lets loose a loud whoop of delight.
 
You raise yourself up in the nakaten, weight balanced entirely on your stirrups, and survey your surroundings.
 
Goldstr affixes his reins to his white horse's bit, and with a firm push off the ground, he swings astride her and settles into a black kidskin-seated saddle with phoenix-etched stirrups.
 
Perigourd pauses for a moment atop your golvern rhinoceros beetle, his profile perfect as he gazes around expectantly.
  
Tebon raises his matte ebon maul high over his head, letting loose a battle cry as if preparing to deal a crushing blow!

Regwen lightly brushes her fingers against the horse's healthy coat.

Perigourd waves his doe trippant standard around enthusiastically, whipping it back and forth through the air.


(Jarnsaixa rolls her shoulder.)
 
Perigourd gets a firm grip on the staff of his doe trippant standard and turns it in a wide, fluttering circle overhead.
 
Arelder rolls back onto his seat bones in his wide saddle, squares his shoulders over his hips, and sits up straight atop his white stallion as he assumes a proper riding posture.
 
 
Kothos gently rubs the neck of the black unicorn he is mounted upon, causing him to whinny softly in response.

Ifanna lets out a cheer!

 
Ifanna waves her Vornavian silk pennon around enthusiastically, whipping it back and forth through the air.
 
You lean forward over your nakaten's pommel ring and sweep your palm along your gold wastesdragon's neck.  His daubed, gold hide quivers at your touch, and he gives a sudden, jerky shake of his wedge-shaped head.


Perigourd rides on a mechanized rhinoceros rhinoceros beetle up a winding track, followed by his group.
 
Roelaren waves her black and red standard around enthusiastically, whipping it back and forth through the air.
 
 
Jastalyn waves a sacrosanct vibrant red battle standard with a rippling pale pink sheen around.

Yunni gently lays a hand on a mottled grey elk's neck, causing him to turn his eyes to meet her.
 
Mourdeyan rubs her sleek crystal sphere, and within moments a blue fire races across the crystalline surface of the statue within, flickering and burning with a pulsating radiance.  The surface of the statue ruffles with ghostly, spectral feathers as the glow rises up from within the glass, shining with the icy hues of frigid snow-capped mountains.  The silhouette of a fiery bird rises upwards from the sphere and takes shape, the twin blazing orbs of its eyes reflecting a miniature world of blizzards and raging storms.


And then the silhouette dims slightly, revealing the form of an ethereal deep blue phoenix.
Perigourd taps his doe trippant standard on the ground before him in a slow, rhythmic beat, drawing attention to himself.

&lt;&lt;arrive at the 
Perigourd recites:
    "Riders may dismount!"


Perigourd removes a woven cornucopia of faewood twigs from in his green leather cloak.
Odelgarde moves to stand behind Jarnsaixa.
 
Perigourd carefully sets a woven cornucopia of faewood twigs down.

Bristenn pats a dun charger firmly on his hindquarter.
A well-muscled dun charger whinnies and gallops off into the distance.
Arelder smiles at the owl.

Perigourd recites:
    " This year we are celebrating the 30th year of the founding of the Silver Gryphons and are honored to offer as prizes for our top three competitors one of a common, an uncommon, or a rare mount with first place being given first choice and so forth. Performances will be judged on aesthetics of the rider and mount, creativity, and the content of their performance. All performances should not exceed three minutes in length."
 
Perigourd recites:
    "It's our privilege to have as our expert panel of judges Sir Guarrin Hjeldin, Knight-Regent of the Order of the Silver Gryphon, Sir Bristenn Mires, Knight-Regent of the Order of the Azure Sun, and Dame Jarnsaixa Vargrdoittr, Imperial Blade and Knight of the Turamzzyrian Empire."

Perigourd recites:
    "At this time I would ask that all competitors whisper to me their official name and title as well as that of the trusted mount they will be performing with."

You say, "If the judges could gather around me so we can discuss the competitors."

Perigourd recites:
    "We also have some tokens of appreciation for attendees in the cornucopia for all to enjoy."
 
You whisper, "Evening to you both." to your group.
 
You are leading Jarnsaixa and Bristenn.
 
Kothos nods understandingly at Raelee.
Missoni recites:
    "While the contestants are getting situated, our first door prize!"
 
Kothos lays his hand on a regal black unicorn's flank, causing her to jump, slightly startled.
 
Speaking to a rugged white stallion, Arelder says, "Easy..."

Tebon waves his grey leather reins through the air and a grey destrier arrives.

 
A black unicorn suddenly tenses, his gaze narrowing slightly as he looks at his surroundings.  Kothos slips his shoulder beneath his neck, his gaze following the path that he is looking at, and lightly touches his cheek in a reassuring gesture.

Yukito collects a white iron medallion from a large compartment inside the amaranth kit.

Yukito removes a thick raw reindeer steak from in his black suede jacket.

Dipping into a lazy dive, the coppery barn owl glides to the ground and lands.
 
  
A white bear snuffs Yukito's hand noisily, prying a thick raw reindeer steak from his fingers with surprisingly gentle jaws.  Any semblance of gentility ends there, though, as he devours the steak in a loud, wet series of chomps before having the mostly good graces to lick his chops clean afterward.
 
 
Gripping firmly with both hands, Giogionni moves his clenched fists together and then yanks them back, pulling a set of lustrous black leather reins taut with a loud "T H W A P"!
 
Speaking formally to Perigourd, you say, "The judges are ready."
 
Perigourd nods to you.
 
 
Perigourd recites:
    "First up we have the gallant Giogionni Wyvernspur, upon their faithful mount Nyx!"


Speaking to Perigourd, Giogionni exclaims, "I hope so!"
 
You see Giogionni Wyvernspur.
He appears to be a Sylvankind of the Lassaran D'ahranal.
He is tall, straight, and well-postured.  He appears to blend confidence with a seasoned perspective.  He has starry, lost-in-thought emerald green eyes and flawlessly smooth, sun-touched skin.  He has chin length, wind-blown moonlight silver hair caught in a chaotic style of pale and dark-streaked strands.  He has a sculpted, refined face, a pair of silver-framed spectacles perched upon his nose and a sharply defined jawline.
He has a silver-traced emerald flame tattoo on his finger, a tattoo of winding dark tendrils and jagged lightning on his leg, an elegantly scripted tattoo on his right wrist, an elegantly scripted tattoo on his left wrist, an elaborate series of overlapping silver sigils tattoo on his right forearm, a silver knotwork tattoo on his right shoulder, a House Sovyn tattoo on his neck, and an inked spiral of tightly coiled silver tendrils on his temple.
He is in good shape.
He is holding a set of lustrous black leather reins in his right hand.
He is wearing a tailored jet black ataela longcoat with an upturned collar, an argent brocade waistcoat fastened with emerald-set silver buttons, an open-necked black silk shirt with silver cufflinks, a knotwork-etched wide silver armband, a knotwork-etched wide silver band, a slender black leather belt with a knotwork-etched silver buckle, a pair of pleated jet black ataela pants, and some polished black leather shoes with silver-tipped laces.
 
Speaking to Giogionni, Perigourd exclaims, "Than you may proceed!"

You see a silver-horned raven-sheened black unicorn.
From muzzle to tail, the unicorn is an uncompromising shade of black with a blue-violet sheen resembling that found on a raven's wing.  His eyes are onyx-hued, flecked with bits of silver so delicate they seem little more than curls of metallic leafing.  His mane and tail are long and silky, and the tufts on his fetlocks bear the same lustrous coloring common to corvids.  A subtle shimmer of silver glints in the natural keratinous formation of his hooves, and his horn is a matte-finished argent spiral.
He is wearing a knitted wisp-patterned viridian pashmina blanket, a scarlet jackdaw-stamped saddle, a length of arabesque-embroidered silk, a quintet of kaleidoscopic glass rings and a curved silver filigree spiral adorning his horn.

 
(Giogionni gives a heavy sigh as Nyx whinnies and shakes her mane.)
 
Odelgarde quietly asks, "Its exciting, isn't it?"
Odelgarde grins.

 
(Giogionni stares blankly at Nyx, who looks away in the opposite direction, deciding instead to start walking backwards.)
 
Giogionni exclaims, "Not backwards!"

 
(Giogionni shakes his head in disbelief as Nyx continues walking backwards, her tail swishing back and forth.)


 
Giogionni assertively says, "Let's move on to the diagonal!  Di.  Ag.  On.  Al."


(Giogionni watches in disbelief as Nyx, in perfect defiance, walks toward the judges' panel.)
 
Giogionni exclaims, "You are not here to flirt with the judges!"
 
Giogionni mischievously says, "That's my job."
 
  
(Giogionni unsuccessfully pulls on the reins as Nyx gives the judges a slight nod.  She then raises her hoof as if to wave!)
 
Giogionni exasperatedly asks, "How about galloping?  Ya think ya can manage to gallop properly?"
 
(Giogionni waits impatiently as Nyx remains perfectly still, a mischievous glint in her eyes.)


Speaking to a rugged white stallion, Arelder says, "He's stealing YOUR act, stubborn one."
Giogionni sighs.
 
Giogionni dejectedly says, "Fine.  Just....  do whatever ya want."


(Giogionni looks hopeful as Nyx performs a perfect pirouette.  And then another.  And another.  His hope fades to a look of utter defeat as Nyx spins faster and faster.  She finally stops spinning and stand perfectly still, though her mane and tail are a twisted, tangled mess.)


(Giogionni folds his arms across his chest, watching Nyx expectantly.  "Are ya done?"  Upon hearing the word "done," Nyx takes off in a full gallop toward the exit, a delighted whinny echoing through the arena as she disappears from sight.)
 
Perigourd points his silver hand mortar at Giogionni and pulls down its lever, causing an explosion of violet essence dust to sparkle around him in the moonlight.
 
Giogionni says, "Ladies and gentleman!  That was...."
 
Perigourd exclaims, "Time!"
Giogionni sighs heavily.
 
Missoni laughs with delight, her eyes full of merriment.
 
Jarnsaixa appears to be trying hard not to grin.

Giogionni dejectedly says, "That was....  Whatever that was."

Speaking to Perigourd, you say, "A moment while the judges discuss."

Perigourd nods to you.
Perigourd says, "Of course."
 
Perigourd says, "Also, if any other individuals wish to perform, again just let me know."
 
Perigourd nods at Raelee.
Yunni nods knowingly.
 
Cryheart turns toward Kothos and renders a sharp salute with his honey drop biscuit.
Missoni recites:
    "While the judges confer, another prize!"
 
You quietly whisper to Perigourd, "Scoring completed, ready for the next."


Perigourd recites:
    "Next we have the incredibly tough Sister-at-arms Ifanna Aynesworth, Standard Bearer of the Order of the Azure Sun, upon the magnificent Goldberry of the Order's  well kept stables!"

Speaking to Ifanna, Perigourd asks, "Are you ready ma'am?"


Ifanna raises her Vornavian silk pennon high into the air for all to see.
 
Perigourd nods approvingly.
 
Speaking brightly to Perigourd, Ifanna answers, "Aye!"
 
 
Ifanna wears an argent Vornavian silk pennon emblazoned with a fiery azure sunburst, securing it to show over her shoulder.

  
Ifanna removes some white leather reins from in her white wool tabard.

 
Speaking to Ifanna, Perigourd exclaims, "At your leisure then!"
 
Ifanna clearly declares, "Me name is Ifanna Aynesworth, Sister-at-armes an' Standard Bearer ov th' Order of the Azure Sun!"

Ifanna confidently announces, "T'night I will be demonstratin' Tilting at th' Rings, once ageen on me steed ov th' order th' courser Goldberry!"
 
Ifanna rubs a white horse.
&gt; 
You see a lithe white horse.
She stands about 16 hands at the withers.  She has a lithe body with a healthy white coat.  She has a square face, a short forelock, and pointed ears.  She has a long mane that flows loosely over one shoulder, and a full black tail.  
She is wearing an embossed soft suede harness, a golden lion-emblazoned saddle and some iron horseshoes.


(Ifanna raises her arm and motions with one of her steel-plate gauntlets towards the grounds. Out of the crowd, several assistants in grey livery trundle out, some dragging with them a number of wooden frames and others sandbags. Each  of the six frames is outfitted with a twine-tied iron ring dangling from its joist.)

Ifanna cheerfully continues, "One've th' many hastlitudes ov knoights an' men-t'armes, Ring Tiltin' is a trainin' game 'longside ridin' th' quintain. One've been playin' fer th' better ov me career!"

Ifanna clearly explains, "T'night not only will I be ridin' down one, but 'aff a dozen wit' me lance 'ere in a loop-- in full 'arness, as tho' I were ridin' inty combat, and fer speed!"

Ifanna draws an iron lance from one of the straps underneath her leather saddle bag.

(Ifanna raises her iron lance high as the grey liveried assistants finish setting up the loop of frame-hung rings around the bonfire. They scamper back into the assembled crowd.)

Ifanna moves to stand near her white horse's head, facing it, and takes hold of the pastern on her left leg, stretching the leg forward, then does the same for right side, ensuring no wrinkles are present under her lion-emblazoned saddle.

Brushing her fingers down a lithe white horse's neck, Ifanna then moves back several steps to grip one of the stirrups hanging down from a lithe white horse and gives it good, hard tug, ensuring that it won't slip once weight is applied to it.

Ifanna takes a deep breath.
Ifanna pulls down the visor of her visored steel armet.
 
Perigourd takes a moment to observe Ifanna.
 
Ifanna affixes her reins to her white horse's bit, and with a firm push off the ground, she swings astride her and settles into a golden lion-emblazoned saddle.

Ifanna leans forward in her saddle and rubs the side of her horse's neck, then pats her gently while quietly uttering several words of encouragement.
Ifanna nudges her white horse slightly with her heels, urging her forward.
Ifanna briskly shouts, "Hiah!"
 
(Ifanna spurs her horse into motion with a sudden thunder of hooves, all the while hoisting her iron lance in a vertical position.)

(Ifanna continues her horse's short yet all out gallop towards the first of the rings, bringing down her iron lance into position.)

(Ifanna's iron lance couched just at the last second, she scores a hit, tearing the ring from its twine as it rattles down the length of her iron lance!)
 
(Ifanna gives her horse a quick nudge with her silver spurs, urging her forward. In a flash, she approaches the second ring of the first loop, this one higher than the other, and cleanly skewers it!)

(Ifanna brings her horse to bear on the third and final ring of the loop's first half, and with the distinct noise of metal sliding against metal, she skewers this one as well! With a snap of the ring's twine, the frame wobbles back and forth under its sandbags while she slows and rounds the bend.)
 
Yunni lets out a cheer!
Collecting a log from a nearby pile, a young aelotoi girl tosses it into a large blazing bonfire, causing flickering embers to rise into the star-strewn sky.
 
Odelgarde waves her vert satin pennon around enthusiastically, whipping it back and forth through the air.

(Ifanna gives her horse a firm nudge with her silver spurs, springing her into action again as she rounds the bend! Her lance couched, she takes aim at the fourth ring, this one lower than the last three.)


(Ifanna handily skewers the fourth ring with her iron lance as she passes by, snapping the twine and sending the frame tumbling to the ground from the force behind her!)
Roelaren applauds.

 
(Ifanna leans forward in her saddle, lance still couched and at the ready, as she passes by the fifth ring-- this one nearly a moment late, but snapped from its twine all the same and clattering down the length of her iron lance.)

(Ifanna nudges her horse once again with her silver spurs, suddenly leaning back as she adjusts her position for the sixth and final ring. With the clear, crisp note of metal against metal, the ring clatters straight down the length of the lance!)
 
Perigourd points his silver hand mortar at Ifanna and pulls down its lever, causing an explosion of violet essence dust to sparkle around her in the moonlight.

(Ifanna breathlessly lowers her lance as her horse thunders to a slow trot, whinnying and shaking her mane. Finally, she slows to a halt, turning her horse with the weight of her body and a brief tug of the reins.)
 
Ifanna raises her iron lance in triumph!
  
Odelgarde waves her vert satin pennon around enthusiastically, whipping it back and forth through the air.
Ifanna pants.
Ifanna pants.
 
Ifanna pants, trying to catch her breath.
 
In a daring display of acrobatics, Ifanna tucks her legs up under herself, momentarily balancing her toes on her lion-emblazoned saddle, then leaps off of it, neatly landing next to her white horse in an overly dramatic dismount.  She reaches up and detaches some white leather reins from her horse's bridle.

Jarnsaixa applauds.
Sweeping her arm outward, Ifanna bows low in a grand fashion.


Delindra waves her battle standard around enthusiastically, whipping it back and forth through the air.
Ifanna idly leans up against a lithe white horse, resting her head against the side of her lion-emblazoned saddle.

Perigourd exclaims, "Quite a wonderful performance! we will await the judges!"

Ifanna plants a quick smooch on a white horse.

Ifanna beams happily!
Ifanna leans on her lance.
Ifanna pants.
Speaking encouragingly to Ifanna, Everall says, "Well done indeed."


Missoni recites:
    "While we await our illustrious judges, another prize!"

  
Speaking to Perigourd, you say, "The judges are ready for the next competitor."



Ifanna put some white leather reins in her white wool tabard.
Ifanna walks over to the boulder and settles down.
Perigourd nods approvingly to you.
 
Perigourd recites:
    "And now we're happy to present the irrepressible Jastalyn Dragorth, riding her svelte rose-sheened charger named Rosie!"
 
Jastalyn turns to face you.
 
Jastalyn recites softly:
    "Today, we bring forth more than a display of strength and elegance
      we offer a living tribute to the divine grace of Oleani, goddess of love."

Jastalyn recites softly:
    "As you gaze upon this noble steed and their devoted rider, see not just flesh and form, but a symbol of harmony between heart and spirit."
  
Jastalyn recites softly:
    "Let your hearts open, as Oleani's light guides this bond between horse and rider, a dance of trust, elegance, and divine affection."
 
 
Jastalyn recites softly:
    "Without futher ado, I give you the one and only, Rosie."


Wrapping her hand around the vaalorn idol pinned to her chest, Jastalyn bows her head forward in prayer.  Ethereal rose light seeps through her fingers in a dazzling spiral along with the fading sound of a charger's whinny.


Jastalyn turns to face a svelte rose-sheened charger.
 
Moving to a rose-sheened charger's side, Jastalyn pats her affectionately on her neck.  She nickers in response, the sound eerily similar to a humanoid chuckle.
 
You see a svelte rose-sheened charger.
She has a svelte body that exudes beauty and elegance.  Her coat is satiny and gleams with a rose-sheened hue that catches the light impeccably.  Perky ears stand attentively atop her delicate face, which is framed by a forelock that is gently draped over her forehead.  She has a long, flowing mane that spills softly down her neck, creating a stunning cascade that enhances her exquisite appearance.  Her soft cream, pert, voluminous tail adds to her overall allure, the perfect vision of majestic grace.
She is wearing a simply woven garland of showy Elanthian snow roses and rose-dyed eyelet lace ribbones, a delicate knitted satiny rose starsilk capelet, a light beige saddle burned with an eight-pointed star and some delicate knitted satiny rose starsilk leg wraps.
Jastalyn issues some commands to a rose-sheened charger, and she bobs her head up and down in response.

Jastalyn reaches up and attaches her star-patterned reins to the charger's bridle, then drapes them over the upright pommel of charger's light beige saddle.
Lightly placing her right foot in the stirrup on the charger's saddle, Jastalyn pushes off of her left foot and transfers her weight into the right as she gracefully mounts her charger's light beige saddle.  She twists her body so that her left foot floats over her charger's girth and slides into the left-side stirrup.  As she positions herself atop her saddle, she takes her reins in hand.

Jastalyn's battle standard leaps to her hand as she pulls it off her back.

Jastalyn raises her battle standard skyward!
 
Jastalyn waves a sacrosanct vibrant red battle standard with a rippling pale pink sheen around.
 
Jastalyn smiles as she coaxes her charger into a galloping gait before the judges, waving her standard in wide, exaggerated arcs. The breeze from the standard ruffles a few stray strands of her gently curled hair.
 
(Jastalyn pats her charger gently on the neck before leading her back to the center of the judging area.)

Jastalyn settles a sacrosanct vibrant red battle standard with a rippling pale pink sheen at her back and canted over one shoulder, where it holds fast despite a lack of bindings.

Jastalyn removes a pale white firework from in her hooded starsilk mantle.
 
Jastalyn carefully sets a pale white firework on the ground.
Jastalyn carefully lights the fuse on a pale white firework, which immediately begins to issue forth a torrent of multi-colored sparks.

 
The fuse on a pale white firework burns down further, issuing a torrent of multi-colored sparks.
(Jastalyn issues a command to her charger and the animal responds by high-stepping in place, each foot in turn, while spinning in a slow circle and flicking her tail in a sweeping arc from side to side.)

 
The fuse on a pale white firework burns down further, issuing a torrent of multi-colored sparks.
The fuse on a pale white firework burns away into the body of the firework.


The white firework issues a violent torrent of pale white sparks from its base and shoots off into the air.  A bright trail of pale white light rises into the nighttime sky above Rumor Woods, vanishing from sight a heartbeat later.

Fleetingly, the black unicorn gazes at Kothos with what can only be described as a bemused yet knowing expression as he touches his a horn to his forehead.  Kothos instantly slips to the ground in a deep slumber.
A shrill whistle precedes a large *BOOM* as glittering points of bright light erupt in the nighttime sky.  A scintillating bright pony trots across a luminous green field before slowly winking out, bits of ash floating towards the ground.
Jastalyn smiles as she gives her charger a gentle nudge with the heel of her boot. The charger rears up on its hind legs and whinnies.
 
Jastalyn issues some commands to a rose-sheened charger, and she bobs her head up and down in response.

Securing her right foot in the saddle's stirrup, Jastalyn twists her body back and to the left, gliding her left leg over the backside of her rose-sheened charger as she gracefully dismounts and detaches some star-patterned reins from her charger's bridle.

Jastalyn recites softly:
    "In the name of Oleani, may you carry forward the spirit of love in every step you take, in every word you speak, and in every kindness you offer."
 
Jastalyn recites softly:
    "May compassion guide your path, and may you always find beauty in even the gentlest moments."


 
Jastalyn gently taps the blush rose charm attached to her silver charm bracelet.  An array of platinum sparks ripples over its surface before settling into a tiny banner of light, the wavering image of a cresting Oleani symbol set into its rippling surface in hues of roseate.  It shimmers for a brief second before fading into a spray of dying platinum and roseate motes.
 

(Jastalyn and her charger bow low in unison towards the judges.)


Perigourd points his silver hand mortar at Jastalyn and pulls down its lever, causing an explosion of violet essence dust to sparkle around her in the moonlight.
 
Perigourd recites:
    "While the judges deliberate, this will be the last call for entrants!"


Missoni recites:
    "A good time for another prize!"

Missoni places a mechanical electrum beetle on the palm of her hand and cranks some shifting urnon gears on its thorax.  The beetle begins gyrating in a circle, some glowing veniom appendages moving rapidly into a blur of motion.  It comes to a stop, buzzing a pair of glass-tiled wings at Kothos!

Speaking formally to Perigourd, you say, "We have concluded our discussion."

Perigourd recites:
    "And our final entrant for the evening, the magnificent Lady Brigit upon their true and faithful Frost!"

Extending his front leg forward in a graceful motion, the hart lowers himself slightly, allowing Brigit to fasten a white lamb's wool halter strap stitched with emerald threading onto his neck.  With a quick motion, she throws one leg across his back as he straightens, and Brigit settles into a comfortable position astride his back.

(Brigit gazes across the crowd from her perch.)
Brigit shifts her weight slightly backward and makes a small click with her tongue.  A pristine white hart slowly leans backwards, lowering himself to the ground in a graceful bow before rising up once more


Brigit reaches down and gives a pristine white hart a playful pinch on his ear.  He goes stock still for a moment, then quick as a flash, he darts his head back and catches her ankle between his teeth, nipping lightly.


Brigit hisses a warning between her teeth, and a pristine white hart tenses, lowering his head slightly and clenching his muscles, preparing to lunge.
 
(Brigit stops and listens to a buzzing bee.)

Brigit lowers her head slightly and places a hand atop a pristine white hart.  Brigit starts to make a low growling noise deep in her throat, and after a moment, he begins to growl along, his muscles bunching beneath her.

 The hart is wearing a white lamb's wool halter strap stitched with emerald threading, some twisted ebon silk ribbons trailing across his antlers, and a knitted honeycomb-patterned pale gold ruhani wool blanket.

(Brigit laughs at Frost's imitation of a bear.)
 
Brigit leans far back, and a pristine white hart rears up beneath her as she grips tightly to his sides with her legs.  He paws at the air once, then twice, his head thrown back in an effort to maintain his balance, before allowing himself to fall back to the ground.

Brigit leans forward and plants a light smooch between a pristine white hart's ears and he grunt softly in response.


Brigit leans slightly to her right atop a pristine white hart.

Brigit climbs down from a pristine white hart neck and carefully detaches a white lamb's wool halter strap stitched with emerald threading from him.
 
Brigit removes a wild carrot from in her tapestry-weave backpack.
Sniffing curiously at the wild carrot in Brigit's palm, a pristine white hart opens his mouth around the offering and snatches it out of her hand, relishing the treat with slow bites.

 
Brigit grabs the hide on both sides of a pristine white hart's neck and gives him a friendly shake.  He opens his mouth and lets his tongue loll out slightly as he tosses his head in time with the motion.

Jarnsaixa says, "A very majestic beast."
 
Brigit gently pushes down on a pristine white hart's forehead and makes a small click with her tongue.  Eyeing her carefully, a majestic pristine white hart slowly leans backwards, lowering himself to the ground in a graceful bow before rising up once more.
 
Perigourd points his silver hand mortar at Brigit and pulls down its lever, causing an explosion of violet essence dust to sparkle around her in the moonlight.

Perigourd recites:
    "We will await the judges final judging and overall scores."

Missoni recites:
    "While the judges tally their scores, a final door prize! Some quite lucky socks."
 
Perigourd recites:
    "During this time I'd invite everyone to keep their eyes and ears open as we continue to celebrate the Silver Gryphons thirtieeth year anniversary throughout the year with an event each month. We are very grateful for all those who have come to support us and to enjoy the evening with us."
  
Perigourd recites:
    "And with that the judges have finished conferring and come to their decision."
 
Perigourd recites:
    "With such wonderful performances, we will also be awarding a 4th place prize this evening as well."

Perigourd recites:
    "In 4th place, we have the wonderful Lady Brigit and her hart Frost!"

Perigourd recites:
    "In third place we have Giogionni and his tumultous steed Nyx!"


Perigourd recites:
    "In second place..."
 
Perigourd recites:
    "We have the wonderful Jastalyn and her delightful charger Rosie!"


Perigourd recites:
    "And in first place we have the resilient and two time competitor Ifanna Aynesworth upon Goldberry!"</pre>
