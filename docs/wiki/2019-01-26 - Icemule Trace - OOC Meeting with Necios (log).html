<pre>You feel tingly all over as you pass through the anomaly!
[Porro Pirate Ship, Cabin]
This cabin has been cleverly designed as a non-threatening consultation lounge perfect for discussing non-issues.  The wooden walls emit an airy pine scent, and several plush, overstuffed chairs and couches have been arranged to encourage relaxation and gentle conversation.  A few papers have been left haphazardly on the floor near a semi-organized desk, and a porthole on the opposite wall provides a view of glimmering, rainbow-colored lights hovering over the sea outside the craft.  You also see a big ugly kobold guard, a massively tall and eternally long roller coaster, an ugly room silencer, a tiny spooky jack-o-lantern, a hovering list, a gargantuan urglaes safe with a circular pattern of glowing runes engraved on the front with a dainty crystal key on it, a carved ice counter with some stuff on it and a tear in the fabric of reality leading to Icemule Trace.
Also here: Amapola, Ellere, Krampton, Pinchot, Twinger, Rongolak, Apprentice Mni who is sitting, Great Lord Kobane who is sitting, GameMaster Necios who is sitting
Obvious exits: none

Necios recites:

    "So as the stragglers arrive, I'm going to outline my part of this evening's discussion, and then we will open the floor for questions and discussion.
     I'd like to ask if you have questions or comments, please save them for the end.
     I will open a list for this purpose to keep the order."

Necios taps a hovering list.

Necios recites:

    "I'm hoping we can keep ambient noise to a minimum, bu tjust in case..."

Necios taps an ugly room silencer.

Necios recites:

    "I think we will be able to handle it without silencing with only a medium sized crowd."


Necios smiles.

Necios recites:

    "So first, I'd like to recap the town's accomplishments in 5118 / 2018."


A big ugly kobold guard thumps the bat in his hand against his opposite palm.

Necios recites:

    "With the assistance of many organizations, we have improved the town community in many ways.
     Several shops were refreshed or updated.
     Clovertooth Hall renovations were completed.
     We met Daukhera and her minions, who are about to pounce again."


Necios recites:

    "Over the summer and into the fall, I also learned how to write my own scripts.  This will prove very handy in the future."


Necios recites:

    "As a result of these upgrades to the town, we have seen a lot of increased traffic in popular resting areas, and an uptick in the population overall.  Citizenship has increased significantly."

Necios recites:

    "My hope is that, with what's to come, this will continue even further.  I'll go over some details about my plans for 5119 / 2019 in just a moment.
     But first there are some pretty critical things I need to address."


Necios recites:

    "Things seem to have calmed down in the last two weeks, but for about a month there, I received a flurry of messages that the town was "falling apart", that "the mayor would be overthrown", and that "everyone would get what they deserved.""

Necios recites:

    "The interesting thing was that no one would point fingers or provide specific evidence."


Necios recites:

    "I am not sure who was behind these disturbances, but I can assure you of a few things.  The mayor isn't going anywhere unless she fails to complete her duties, or wishes to exit her role dramatically, neither of which she has expressed to me yet."


A big ugly kobold guard thumps the bat in his hand against his opposite palm.

Necios recites:

    "Second, if someone is planning a personal roleplay or storyline, that is not a violation of policy unless they are disrupting your gameplay.  Examples of disruption include preventing you from playing somehow, killing you, etc."


Necios recites:

    "The mayor is Tawariell Andrenae."


Necios recites:

    "If someone, for example, roleplays a mass murderer and goes around town killing everyone in sight, the deputy will handle that."


Necios recites:

    "Something so egregious can result in a temporary or permanent banishment from town without my intervention at all."


Necios resists the bolt.

Necios grins.

Necios says, "Let's try to keep the background noise to a minimum."

Necios recites:

    "Anyway, this is a great opportunity to remind you of a few tools you have:  WARN INTERACT or WARN HARASS, ASSIST, and REPORT."


Necios recites:

    "For a while, people were accusing me of not being the Icemule police 24/7.
     As much as I'd like this role, I need sleep as much as anyone, plus I have a job."


Necios flashes a wide grin.

Necios recites:

    "*ANY* GameMaster has the authority to discipline policy violations in any part of the game.  This is why ASSIST and REPORT are so important in tandem with the WARN verb."


Necios recites:

    "If you don't want someone to drag you into their roleplay, just say no!  If they don't leave you alone, you have recourse."


Necios recites:

    "Additionally, it has come to my attention that several folks have been speaking on behalf of others, including officers of the government, the MHOs, White Haven, and *ME*."

Necios recites:

    "If it doesn't come from me or the mouth of the person, it is likely a rumor."


Necios recites:

    "I'd love to give examples, but it would likely only further the cause of the gossipers and rabble rousers."


Necios recites:

    "Suffice to say, I'm not going anywhere, and neither is the mayor.  As of tonight there are no storylines in progress... but I have yet to cover what's coming up"

Necios grins.


Necios recites:

    "If you're lost, that's good.  It means you haven't been party to the misinformation and rumors that only serve to trouble the locals."


Necios takes a drink from his white chocolate mocha.
A bit of foam clings to his upper lip.


Necios recites:

    "I'll take questions and comments about that in just a moment."


Necios chuckles.

Necios recites:

    "Now, I'm going to cover plans for this year."


Necios applauds.

Necios takes a drink from his white chocolate mocha.
As Necios lowers the mocha, you notice a mustache of thick foam on his upper lip.

Necios recites:

    "Coming up first is an explanation of why things take so long.
     Let me give you an example."

Necios recites:

    "Clovertooth Hall was conceptualized in June of last year, and released in December 29."


Necios recites:

    "That's about 6 months for a major expansion to come to fruition."

Necios recites:

    "I remember as a player, "Wow, that's so cool!  More, more, more, RIGHT NOW!""

Necios recites:

    "Keep that in the back of your mind for few minutes."

Necios recites:

    "Since November, I have been working with Tawariell's council and some volunteers to throw the first ever Icemule street fair."


Necios recites:

    "It will be a free event, with silvers shopping, and it will take place in early March.  I can't release dates yet because things are always bouncing around."

Necios recites:

    "The event will be shop-medium, raffle-medium, and GALD merchant-heavy."

Necios recites:

    "This is a FREE event with FREE-tier expectations for goods."

Necios recites:

    "But we are so flimmin' flammin' excited about it."

Necios recites:

    "It will attract a lot of attention to Icemule, especially the player-run organization hosted games."

A big ugly kobold guard gazes warily out a nearby porthole for a time.

Necios recites:

    "Look forward to this long weekend festival announced very, very soon (once I get approved to announce it)."


Necios says, "I'm super happy to spend the weekend with the town in this way, and to set a precedent for future festivals."

Necios smiles.

Necios recites:

    "Second of all, there is a REALLY neat release coming whenever I can finish it and it can get through QC."


Necios recites:

    "It is an addition to Icemule that fits right in with its flavor, a competition of sorts."


Olgretien deeply asks, "Tart eatin contest?"

Speaking to Olgretien, Necios says, "No, but that's a good idea.  Let me right that down."

Necios recites:

    "It is something that orgs and individual players will be able to enjoy for years to come, and I'm really thrilled to finish it."


Roblar deeply asks, "Does it involve snowballs?"

Necios says, "No snowballs yet, but I do have an idea further down the list."

Necios says, "Silvermule Hall is surprisingly lacking in games, so adding a contest there would be neat."

Necios says, "My list of things I want to code is like 34 items long."

Roblar deeply says, "Just the old wheel."
&gt;
Necios nods.

Necios frowns.

&gt;
Necios says, "There's a dart board, too, but sans darts."


Speaking quietly to Necios, Eldanari asks, "Can yah squeeze in snowball fights?"

Speaking to Eldanari, Necios says, "It's on there."

Nodyre says, "There's more to Silvermule than the games."

Speaking to Nodyre, Necios asks, "House lockers?"

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre says, "Something like that."

Necios waves his hand in a dismissive gesture.

Necios recites:

    "So these "projects" that we're discussing... just so you know.  It can take 1 - 2 months to code, then 2 months for quality control and debugging, then waiting for an appropriate time to release."

Necios recites:

    "What I'm trying to encourage is an understanding of the GM perspective.  It's great to have 34 ideas, but you have to be patient."

A big ugly kobold guard catches himself staring blankly off into space, and he shuffles around for a moment.

Necios wipes some thick foam off his face with his hand.

Twinger says, "Or get more GMs."

Speaking to Twinger, Necios says, "That isn't my call.  For the time being, I have my responsibilities set."

Speaking to Twinger, Necios says, "I understand where you're coming from.  But even hiring 10 new GMs right now wouldn't solve immediate problems.  The training process is LONG."

Speaking to Twinger, Necios says, "And Icemule, given that is already has a guru, is not a critical needs area."

Twinger says, "I understand, used to be the head GM at another game."

Necios says, "Glad to have you here with your expertise, then."

Necios smiles at Twinger.

Necios says, "Next on the list is ICICLE's update to Wurt's Amulet(s)."

Necios recites:

    "Other upgrades on the way are a town alarm and upgrades to the defense systems."

Necios recites:

    "These are important given the Town Guard's formation."

Necios recites:

    "Last, what you've all been waiting for..."

Necios recites:

    "I have just been approved to run The Dusk of Daukhera, or the conclusion of last year's story arc, from now until March 31."

&gt; * Chozenone joins the adventure.
cheer nec
Nodyre turns to Necios and cheer!
&gt;
Jalodg's jaw drops.
&gt;
Kobane turns to Necios and cheers!
&gt;
Lylia turns to Necios and cheers!
&gt;
Brokkrsten nods approvingly.
&gt;
Jalodg melodically exclaims, "Woo!"
&gt;
Jastalyn lets out a cheer!
&gt;
Necios recites:

    "I have so many exciting things planned, especially for those who are engaged regularly."

A big ugly kobold guard thumps the bat in his hand against his opposite palm.

Necios recites:

    "New, temporary ruins to explore, souvenirs, roleplay rewards (not just RPAs)...."

Necios recites:

    "And of course, the salty Queen herself."

Necios recites:

    "I am going to aim for one story night per week, probably over the weekend, and 2 bonus nights per month.  This prevents me from spreading myself too thin."

Necios recites:

    "These will likely take place during prime time hours (9 - 10pm eastern)."

Necios recites:

    "This time, however, I'm not going to announce ahead of time except for a few crucial moments, and I will use the forums to do so."


Twinger says, "I wish you could get a negative RPA so you could slow your growth, I never want to grow up."

Speaking to Twinger, Necios says, "You CAN get a negative RPA... we just don't use them except for breaking policy."

Necios grins.

Necios recites:

    "This storyline will culminate with the addition of some Mhoragian halfling lore, because every race has a dark side..."


Necios cackles deep in his throat, his voice rising in chilling laughter.

Necios recites:

    "Here is the critical point, and I hope you're still logging for those who aren't here."

Necios recites:

    "IF YOU FEEL LIKE you have a personal storyline that will mesh with Daukhera and the Far Market, in case they appear, email me (GS4-NECIOS@PLAY.NET) or Discord (Necios#1147)."

Necios recites:

    "This is one of those cases where I may be able to tie the two together.  However, I need advance notice!  "Hey, you around tonight for me to do this complicated storyline that needs 100 props?"  No."

Necios recites:

    ""Hey, can you peak in as XYZ explores tonight?"  Yes, if I am available."

Necios recites:

    "I will answer Communions if they are scheduled in advance, I'll peek in on strategy sessions as to how to "defend" the city, whatever."

Necios recites:

    "But if something needs STUFF, I need to know a week or two in advance at minimum.  So please message me now and let's begin a dialogue.  The story will begin next week!"

Necios recites:

    "I think that's all the official notice that I have!"

Necios recites:

    "I'm going to open the list for questions and comments now, so JOIN it if you have something to share."

You read over the hovering list, which has the following names written on it:

  (1) Kobane
  (2) Nodyre
  (3) Mni
  (4) Fuil
  (5) Olgretien
  (6) Twinger
  (7) Jalodg

Necios points at Kobane.

Speaking quietly to Necios, Kobane asks, "I just had a minor question.. Is there anything we can do about pickers at TC?"

Necios asks, "What about them?"

Speaking quietly to Necios, Kobane says, "It's a;ways been frowned upon, yet people always pick there."

Necios says, "There is one way, which would turn Town Center into a sort of safe haven similar to the Voln garden."

Necios says, "I am opposed to this because of several reasons: demons, invasions, and fun for me."

Necios grins.

A big ugly kobold guard gazes warily out a nearby porthole for a time.

Ondreian says, "Many people need to pick in public places because of the way the guild is designed."

Ondreian says, "You shouldn't penalize some poor sob trying to work on audience reps."

Necios nods.

Necios says, "Nowadays at least."

Necios says, "If you notice someone picking, you could politely ask them to step to the side to disarm."

Kobane quietly asks, "I understand rogues need reps, but maybe some kind of incentive for reps at the well?"

Necios says, "I'm not sure if any kind of incentive system already exists, but I can check.  No promises though."

Nodyre says, "I would love for the stucco well to be used again, but until locksmithing itself is improved that's not happening."

Speaking to Nodyre, Necios says, "The well area will be used again soon, but for a different reason."

Necios winks.

Speaking to Kobane, Necios asks, "Was that extend of your questions?"

Kobane nods at Necios.

Necios smiles at Kobane.

Necios says, "Thanks for sharing."

Necios points at Nodyre.

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre asks, "Will the street fair you mentioned have a cultural theme, a municipal theme, or a bit of both?"

Necios says, "Definitely a bit of both."

Necios says, "I don't think it's possible in Icemule to have a municipal fair without cultural elements.  The two are tightly bound here."

Necios exclaims, "It's very unique.  You'll see!"

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre says, "Splendid. Thank you."

Speaking to Nodyre, Necios asks, "Was that all from you?"

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre says, "Oh! one other thing."

Necios nods to Nodyre.

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre asks, "Any chance you might be able to loop some Wsalamir Giant stuff into your storylines?"

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre says, "They've been woefully underrepresented."

Necios says, "I'm cautious about anything giant because of the ice giant truce."

Necios says, "But we can look at it.  If you could message me on Discord or email me, that'd be great."

Necios says, "The storyline that follows over the summer and fall will be distinct from Daukhera, but have some old and new elements."

Nodyre nods at Necios.

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre says, "I was hoping for something while she was digging on the mountain, but was just a thought."

Necios whispers, "Where she's going to end up "digging" has already been defined."

Necios winks.

Necios says, "But this is why it's important to submit ideas early."

Necios says, "A lot of things have to go through various levels of senior staff approval to make sure they don't conflict with previous or game-wide lore."

Necios says, "This can take a while, hence, early discussions are best."

Necios recites:

    "If you're so inspired that you have a WHOLE storyline to submit (that you are *not* the star of), reach out!  We can work together.  I love involving players, because players love seeing their writing come to life."

Necios recites:

    "That's the reason I became a GM."

Necios grins.

Necios points at Mni.

Mni stands up.

Necios smiles at Mni.

Mni curtsies to Necios.

Mni coughs.

Mni quietly asks, "Can you clarify the term length of the Mayor, and also clarify the location of the citizenship office and the citizen's tent that ICICLE built?"

Necios says, "Yes."

Mni inclines her head.

Mni sits down.

A big ugly kobold guard leans toward the door, ears raised, with a suspicious look on his face.

Necios recites:

    "Shortly after the mayor was elected, I decided that Icemule's player mayor (or future NPC mayor, if no players wish to run) would run for 2 real calendar years."

Necios recites:

    "There are a few reasons for this.
     1)  It gives the mayor time to do things like conceptualize town-wide events and contribute a lasting impression.
     2) It gives me the free time to work on other big projects.  The mayor election storyline was barely 5 weeks in the live game, but required 3 months of preparation behind the scenes.  It's a giant time consumer.
     3) If the mayor fails to complete their duties, they can be removed from office, absolutely.  Player disappears for 2 months without a word?  Outta there, special election."

Necios grins.

Mni nods at Necios.

Mni quietly says, "That clears up some misinformation I received, then."

Mni smiles at Necios.

Speaking to Mni, Necios asks, "Can you say or whisper what information you received in case I can clarify further?"

Mni quietly says, "I was under the misconception that the Mayor was to be removed, and earlier discussions about something to do with Ta'Vaalor intimated that she would be removed."

Mni nods at Necios.

Necios recites:

    "If the mayor is to be removed, you will hear it from me on the forums, or the mayor will resign herself.  No other town can take down the mayor.  There is no overthrowing here unless the mayor agrees to it and I agree to it."

Mni nods understandingly at Necios.

Mni quietly says, "There is a story about it in the Wikipedia."

Mni nods at Necios.

Speaking to Mni, Necios asks, "There is a gswiki article?"

Speaking quietly to Necios, Mni says, "Yes, I will find it and send it to you."

Mni nods at Necios.

A big ugly kobold guard gazes warily out a nearby porthole for a time.

Necios smiles at Mni.

Necios recites:

    "The citizen's tent is a few steps south of Town Center.  Inside, there are various spaces for roleplay as well as an assortment of food and donation bins."

Necios recites:

    "The remodeled citizenship office is on the 2nd floor of Clovertooth Hall.  Go into the lobby, up the stairs, and to the west a couple steps.  There is a sign pointing to the counter, and you GO COUNTER."

Necios recites:

    "Belfionn wished to move from a drab office closer to the luxury of the executive suits."

Necios recites:

    "Suites, too."

Speaking to Necios, Bellaja says, "Same difference."

A bolt of lightning streaks down from the sky and strikes Bellaja!
   ... 15 points of damage!
   Shocking jolt to forehead.  Painful.
   She is stunned!

A tremendous crack of thunder follows instantly!

Necios gazes heavenward.

Necios exclaims, "Crackly today!"

Speaking to Mni, Necios asks, "Any other questions?"

Mni quietly says, "No sir, thank you."

Necios points at Fuil.

Speaking to Necios, Fuil asks, "First, if someone with style, grace, and a confident humility that only a halfling empath can possess has ideas about the town (shops, a nice decoration, etc.) is it best to go through a player organization or contact you directly?"

Fuil shifts his weight.

Fuil grins.

Necios says, "ICICLE, the MHO, is currently tasked with upgrading the shops and structures.  I believe they may have an opening now.  Dirvy and Laralana are the chair and co-chair."

Fuil turns to Necios and cheers!

Speaking to Fuil, Laralana exclaims, "Happy to help... I can chat with you after this meeting if you like!"

Fuil nods at Laralana.

Fuil grins.

Necios says, "If they don't have an open space, you are welcome to message me your ideas, and if it's not a project they are interested in, we can look at your ideas together."

Necios smiles at Fuil.

Fuil beams happily at Necios!

Speaking to Necios, Fuil asks, "Second, this is a general comment/question about story lines..I generally like to think that I am able to read and understand the information I am reading, but is there a storylines for dummies somewhere? Everything seems so vague that I just cannot follow it..If this is all by design, I   m good, I just often feel like I   m missing something. Basically, is this normal?"

Necios says, "I don't think there is a storyline for dummies, though that sounds like a great gswiki article."

Fuil takes a deep breath.

Fuil nods at Necios.

A big ugly kobold guard catches himself staring blankly off into space, and he shuffles around for a moment.

Speaking to Necios, Fuil says, "I remember reading one about a woman looking out of a window and a letter was involved, and I had NO idea what was happening."

Necios says, "I do know that several of the beginning aspects of the Dawn of Daukhera were posted as an article called The Troubles on gswiki."

Necios says, "Forums, TownCrier, Discord, lots of places to get up to speed."

Fuil nods at Necios.

Necios says, "I think I've covered all the bases.  But a lot of times, it's just coming and trying to stay alive, then talking to townsfolk."

Necios grins.

Fuil nods at Necios.

Speaking to Necios, Fuil exclaims, "That is all. Also, just on a personal note, thank you to you and all the staff for keeping a text-based 30 year old game so alive and vibrant!"

Necios exclaims, "We love to hear that.  Positive feedback rocks.  Thank you!!"

Speaking to Necios, Fuil says, "New things at all are amazing! even if it takes months. We've come so far from the 90's."

Necios says, "I agree."

Fuil nods.

Necios says, "We've even come so far since 2012 when I first came on staff."

Necios says, "Okay, 15 minutes, but I'm goin to try to get to everyone."

Necios points at Olgretien.

Olgretien deeply asks, "Two quick questions. 1. Will we be getting our ballista back or are the defense upgrades going to address that/make it irrelevant?"

Speaking to Olgretien, Necios says, "Yes.  I'm so sorry it has taken so long, but I want to recode it completely to make it 100% icemule.  For example:  pouring boiling hot water down that immediately freezes into ice patches, firing giant icicles, and cold-flaring arrows.  No promises, but it's #4 on my coding list."

Necios says, "They are currently non-functional and who knows how long they have been broken."

Olgretien nods.

Olgretien deeply says, "Wnder what broke them, they used to work fine."

Necios says, "I also want them to be super easy to use.  Auto-finding of critters outside and inside town walls, with the occasional friendly fire."

Necios says, "I won't know until I look, but some things just... break sometimes."

Necios grins.

Necios asks, "Do you remember the last time you used them?"

Olgretien ponders.

Olgretien deeply says, "Within a year prior to it disappearing."

Necios nods.

Olgretien deeply says, "Used ot fire it when giving tours of the defenses."

Necios says, "The last time someone was up there was a little over a year ago, iirc, and it was shouting off bug alarms, so I had to close it."

Olgretien nods.

Necios says, "Could have been for any number of reasons.  I will look and see if it is an easy fix and re-open them before I re-release them with all my new ideas."

Olgretien deeply says, "Second, and relatedly. will there be a chance to use the wall defenses during the coming invasions?  I know folks have spent lots of time keeping the walls clear.  I can't recall ever having a battle where folks on the walls kept the enemy at bay for some time."

Speaking to Olgretien, Necios asks, "Forgive my ignorance, but what's the difference between wall defenses and what we were just talking about?"

Necios says, "Before you laugh at the GM who doesn't know, there are thousands of rooms in the Icemule realm."

Olgretien deeply says, "The ballista is just a single part."

Olgretien deeply says, "You can fire out off the walls all the way around town."

Olgretien deeply says, "THrough the crenels, fire bolts and arrows."

Speaking to Olgretien, Necios says, "Hang out after the meeting and let's take a look."

Olgretien deeply says, "I could gove you a tour."

Olgretien nods.

Necios says, "It may have all gotten disabled when I disabled the ballistas."

Olgretien deeply says, "No, they work fine."

Necios asks, "So if they're working fine, then I imagine you can use the wall defenses during an invasion...?"

Speaking to Olgretien, Laralana asks, "Oh they work... You're just requesting a storyline battle where we have the chance to use them in a storyline?"

Olgretien deeply says, "That is correct."

Olgretien nods at Laralana.

Speaking to Olgretien, Necios says, "Ahhh, I see."

Olgretien deeply says, "Ever since they were built, the enemy just bypasses them completely."

Olgretien rolls his eyes.

Speaking to Olgretien, Necios says, "Well, the issue with Daukhera is, she just pops up in town."

Necios chuckles.

Necios says, "She stakes claim to all the land, and takes particular issue with the Paradis settlement."

Speaking to Olgretien, Necios says, "This is just one storyline, though."

Olgretien nods.

Necios asks, "Why approach the gates when you're the Queen?"

Necios grins.

Olgretien deeply says, "And i realise you have already worked on it nad have plans, just send some ice giants."

Olgretien winks at Necios.

Necios pinches Olgretien!

Olgretien lets out a yelp!

Necios points at Twinger.

Twinger says, "Two quick questions."

Twinger says, "Do I have to be a citizen of ice mule to participate."

Necios shakes his head.

Twinger says, "I hate to read - it's so OOC."

Twinger says, "Why not have an NPC that is vversed in storylines."

Twinger says, "THat tells the story."

Twinger says, "That's it."

Necios says, "That's a great suggestion.  A wandering hag that you can ASK about certain things."

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre says, "Just repurpose the old halfling that wanders about."

Speaking to Nodyre, Necios says, "No.  That's a GS3 relic and I love him."

Twinger says, "I have them occasionally - an abundance of pills does that."

Twinger says, "I just hate when people tell me a wiki address rather than telling me about the storyline."

Necios says, "Okay, so an automated NPC will take 2 - 3 weeks to appear.  Approvals, design, quality control."

Necios says, "But I like that idea very much, and she/he could be repurposed."

Necios says, "Maybe even a talking animal."

Necios says, "I also hope that people will be willing to post on the forums so Newsby will catch happenings, as well as update the wiki in brief."

Necios says, "I can't do all the things, I'm so sorry."

Necios says, "TownCrier reminds me of the days I need to merchant like 80% of the time."

Necios recites:

    "The meeting is officially over as it was only scheduled until 11.  Feel free to stay or leave."

Necios points at Jalodg.

A big ugly kobold guard leans toward the door, ears raised, with a suspicious look on his face.

Jalodg melodically says, "One question in two awkward chunks. It's not Icemule specific, no worries if there's not enough time to answer right now."

Jalodg melodically asks, "I'm glad that you mentioned WARN and other mechanisms to deal with harassment. Could you outline a good example/procedure on how someone playing a mischievous character can pull another player/character that would potentially cause them pickpocketing, theft, harm or death?"

Jalodg melodically asks, "Could the 'offending' pickpocket, ambush or take some negative action first and see if the other player wants to go along with it? Should the 'offending' player reach out to the other player first before having their mischievous character engage (which might take away from the surprise and excitement of the RP and mechanical stakes)?"

Speaking to Jalodg, Necios says, "Okay, so pickpocketing is a permissible mechanic.  If you SEE someone pickpocket you or someone else, you can ACCUSE them at the deputy's office or in front of the deputy."

Necios says, "Otherwise, close your containers and keep your pockets empty of silvers."

Jalodg nods at Necios.

Necios says, "So that's not a violation of policy."

Necios says, "As far as attacking goes, the CHALLENGE verb is your solution."

Necios says, "You can challenge someone to first blood or first death."

Necios says, "Killing or hurting someone in town has its own repercussions."

Necios points at Rongolak.

Rongolak says, "I just had a request to add Voaris and Laethe more to the town, since Oleani is the patron arkati of halflings, it seems fitting and would be nice to see them included as lesser spirits to the town, maybe a statue with the three of them with halflings cavorting about."

Rongolak says, "That's all."

Necios says, "I like that.  I'm not sure they could be altars to those deities unless they were outside of the town because of the temple having so many deities."

Rongolak nods.

Rongolak says, "Bring the love back is all I'm askin."

Necios says, "Maybe ICICLE could be involved with that.  It's on my list now."

Necios points at Rucer.

Rucer says, "I had to stop out earlier, so apologies if I missed any question or discussion regarding this already. I wanted to also request a perm sanctuary in TC, not only to prevent non-consentual PvP in a resting spot, but also to prevent scarabs from latching onto everyone in the room, if a box should go awry. Of course, said sanctuary can and should go away during storytime."

Speaking to Rucer, Necios says, "A permanent sanctuary has been requested and declined in town center for decades."

Rucer nods understandingly at Necios.

Necios says, "It has been turned down each time as well."

Necios says, "Part of the reason for this is honoring the original town designer's wishes."

A big ugly kobold guard leans toward the door, ears raised, with a suspicious look on his face.

Necios says, "Another part of this is... not every town center should be a permasanct."

Necios shrugs.

Necios exclaims, "A third part is DEMONS!"

Necios says, "We allow demons in the open, and with a permasanct, they couldn't hang ou t there."

Fuil asks, "If it was permasanct, would that do something about all the smooching that goes on in TC?"

Necios says, "It would increase the smooching."

Speaking to Necios, Rucer says, "Alright, wasn't the answer I'm looking for, but I'll continue to use the tools I have available to prevent non-consnetual PvP. Thank you."

Necios says, "I've put it on my list, but I am uncertain as to whether that request will be re-evaluated."

Rucer smiles at Necios.

Necios nods at Rucer.

Necios smiles.

Necios says, "That setting on an area is not something I can do on my own."

Necios points at all the hierarchies.

Necios grins.

Necios says, "But it's on my growing list."

Necios points at Sabotage.

Sabotage asks, "Do you have an idea how long this chapter of the storyline is going to be?  Any plans for arkati involvement in it, say all that banging waking up Koar or something?"

Necios says, "I invite communes to any appropriate deity."

Necios says, "I don't know if those deities will reply."
&gt;
Necios says, "I know a well done ceremony will invite a reply."
&gt;
Necios says, "This chapter will be over on or around March 31."

Necios says, "But this chapter will involve more exploration, puzzles, a fair bit of slaying, and a few final revelations."

Sabotage asks, "Is this the final chapter?"

Necios says, "This is Daukhera's final chapter."
&gt;
Necios says, "There are elements that will continue to the next part."

Nodyre says, "We'll probably see Thurfel again."

Necios grins.

A big ugly kobold guard gazes warily out a nearby porthole for a time.

Necios says, "I do not have any plans to resurrect Thurfel."

Speaking to Sabotage, Necios asks, "Was that your final question?"

Sabotage nods.
&gt;
Sabotage says, "Thanks for your time tonight."

Necios asks, "Great.  That's all that's on the list... does anyone have anything further?"

Speaking to Necios, Bellaja asks, "Are there set storyline nights?"

Speaking to Bellaja, Necios says, "No, though I will announce BIG nights in advance."

Bellaja nods at Necios.

Speaking to Bellaja, Necios says, "My time frame is usually 9 or 10 eastern starting on a weekend night."

Bellaja nods at Necios.

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre asks, "Any plans for the rift or Pinefar this year?"

Speaking to Nodyre, Necios asks, "What kind of plans?"

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre asks, "Enhancements / storylines?"

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre says, "Let me rephrase."

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre asks, "Is ICICLE able to coordinate improvements to Pinefar?"

Nodyre says, "More like getting an herb box."

Nodyre says, "Instead of the dang cupboard."

Nodyre says, "Having the fire always lit."

Speaking to Nodyre, Necios says, "Enhancements of the critter type are team Dev's responsibility.  Storylines are possible, or portions of storylines."

Speaking to Nodyre, Necios says, "As far as enhancements to the Pinefar area, like building extensions or whatnot, those would likely not be approved."

Necios takes a drink from his white chocolate mocha.
As Necios lowers the mocha, you notice a mustache of thick foam on his upper lip.

Necios says, "It's an outpost, not a town.  But I do believe updates are possible there."

Speaking to Necios, Laralana asks, "As in redecoration, but not editing the structures?"

Speaking to Laralana, Necios says, "Structures are easy to change, relatively.  But remember, people get upset because they use lich."

Necios says, "And maps have to be changed."

Speaking to Necios, Laralana says, "Ohh, right."

Laralana nods understandingly at Necios.

Necios says, "If Pinefar Outpost is something that wants to be changed, let's work on a proposal together."

Necios says, "That's another of those 2 - 6 month projects."

Nodyre nods at Necios.

Laralana agrees with Necios.

Speaking to Necios, Nodyre asks, "Best to email that? Or official forums post?"

Speaking to Nodyre, Necios says, "For proposals, email or Discord.  ICICLE has a procedure in place already for proposals to existing areas."

Speaking to Nodyre, Necios says, "You may want to speak with them."

Necios exclaims, "Thank you all so much for being so appreciative.  I appreciate you as well!"

Necios smiles.
