Rectangular in shape, the chamber's ceiling is a soaring vault of reflective silver-gilt mosaic. Beneath the glassy mirror is an open expanse of polished stone flooring and a half-moon rostrum, the surface raised three stairsteps above the rest of the room. Atop the dais is a large silver chair inlaid with sapphires. Down a step is a solid silver throne. A carved mistwood door, paneled in silver plating, blends into the long wall of the hall, and a wide velvet-draped arch is recessed opposite the platform leading back to the main area of the keep. You also see a guardsman.
Also here: Lady Erienne, Lord Kothos, Aeriadrn, Bathcwyn Missoni, Stassy, Giogionni, Yunni, Arbeia, Rivienne, Sir Balantine, Perigourd, Lady in Waiting Lynaera, Miss Lissaya, Lady Vellani, Lord Teveriel
Obvious exits: none
Teveriel smiles at Rivienne.
Arbeia glances at Giogionni.
Giogionni glances at Arbeia.
You see Rivienne Mandaire Loenthra.
She appears to be an Elf.
She is petite and has a balletic body. She appears to have come of age. She has demure violet eyes and silken alabaster skin. She has long, free-flowing starling black hair arranged in an intricately twisted roll at the back of her head and held in place by some silvery blue rivertears. She has narrow, delicately pointed ears. Her aspect embodies a fluid symmetry of sharp angles and gentle curves. She has a semi-sheer pearlescent glaze brushed onto her well-manicured fingernails.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing a beryl blue chainsil cloak split hood to hem by a band of violet sunbird feathers, a cool-toned cloudsilk gown draped from a trifoliate skyglass gorget, twin silvery handflowers constellating diamonds over the back of each hand, and some blue-violet braided satin sandals.
Kothos casually observes the area as he traces small circles beneath his pectoral.
Aeriadrn nods to a sapphire-clad herald, the young elf bowing his head slightly before tapping the end of his feather-carved cane against the ground thrice in succession.
Aeriadrn formally announces, "Ladies and gentlemen, citizens, and guests of the Shining City, we welcome you to this estival session."
Aerocus says, "Ello, hot pan, hoat pan."
You see Aerocus the Bounty Hunter.
He appears to be a Giantman of the T'Kirem Clan.
Drawn up over his head is a dark leather hood, the edge partially shading his features. Plush wolverine fur lines the interior of the hood, the black-tipped silver pelt framing his face.
He is average height. He appears to have come of age. He has feral misty green eyes and tanned skin. He has a shaven head of coal black hair swept back from the temples. He has a square-jawed face, a flaring nose and deep laugh lines.
He has crisp white feathers painted on his face accompanied by a bright yellow nose.
He has a chain of cheeky monkeys tattoo on his neck, a square fishing net tattoo on his wrist, a skull and crossbones tattoo on his wrist, and a squat-faced fishing cat tattoo on his neck.
He is in good shape.
He is holding an iron frying pan in his right hand.
He is wearing a dragon blood bark amulet, a black grizzly fur-lined cloak, a sinuous ruic longbow suffused with argent undertones slung over his shoulder, a ring-bound iron grey leather bandolier over a mottled vultite coat-of-plates with turtle shell pauldrons, a cross-wrapped bistre leather shirt, a set of articulated steel gauntlets buckled down the forearms, a narrow platinum band traced with a repeating pattern of hooked thorns, a gilt-knuckled set of vert cloisonne finger-armor, a neutral-toned pouch of diamond-scaled rattlesnake skin, an ora-handled fishing net stained with pallid sanguine blood, a shaggy dark grey wolf fur satchel, a plaid pleated kilt with a silver dagger pin, and a pair of gradient knitted fish-patterned blue tweed socks under a pair of rugged climbing boots.
Aeriadrn says, "We welcome all visiting dignitaries and delegates to our city-state, we consider ourselves fortunate for your presence and welcome you to the Shining City."
Aeriadrn says, "We remind the audience that all weaponry must remain sheathed when in The Argentate."
Aerocus removes some seared trout seasoned with coconuts and flathead mushrooms from in his frying pan.
Aeriadrn says, "We also remind the audience that we expect decorum and civility while in the presence of the Mirror Incumbent and Her entourage."
Aerocus takes a bite of his seared trout.
Aerocus asks, "Not eating?"
You gaze with interest at Aerocus.
Pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger, Giogionni shakes his head toward Aerocus, staring at him in disbelief.
Aeriadrn says, "We will hear petitions at the end of the formal session and requests should be directed to myself."
Giogionni appears to be trying hard not to grin.
Khobra looks over at Aerocus and shakes her head.
Aeriadrn takes a measured look at the audience before bowing his head briefly, then proceeds to lean upon his cane as he approaches the right side of the silver throne.
Aerocus works his fingers under his leather hood and scratches his head.
You see Aeriadrn Ghaeriden Illistim the Seneschal of Ta'Illistim Keep.
He appears to be an Elf.
He is tall and has a narrow-shouldered frame. He appears to be aged. He has small, flinty grey eyes and pale skin. He has shoulder length, thick platinum hair neatly bound by a pavonated velvet ribbon. He has an angular face and a sharp, pointed chin.
He is in good shape.
He is holding a vaalin-handled cane of feather-carved pale willow in his right hand.
He is wearing a hip-length pavonated silk tunic affixed with a silver-chained cape of lily-motif brocade, an enameled silver signet ring, an oil-polished dove grey leather hip-belt, a silver-framed pale willow case, a pair of pallid ruhani wool hosen reinforced along the calves, and a pair of perforated charcoal suede shoes lined in sapphire silk.
The sapphire-clad herald announces, "Captain Arastir Avelleur."
Arastir just came through a wide velvet-draped arch.
You see Arastir Avelleur Illistim the Sapphire Dragoon.
He appears to be an Elf.
He is tall and has a muscular, able-bodied physique. He appears to be an adult. He has almond-shaped vibrant larkspur blue eyes and fair skin. He has long, silky greyish blonde hair bound in dual leather-woven braids across his shoulders, the length left unrestrained as it flows down his back. He has a square-jawed face, a strong, sloping nose and a faint knick across his right eyebrow.
He is in good shape.
He is wearing a leather-toggled iron grey vicuna half-cape slung over his shoulder, a suit of vethinye-crafted platemail affixed to a pauldron of bluish green imflass feathers with a throat-fastened sapphire suede jupon veiled in fine silvered mesh underneath, a set of wisteria-etched vethinye gauntlets, a pair of rein-suspended ashen leather trousers reinforced in suede across the seams, and some leather-strapped vethinye sabatons riveted in tonal imflass.
Arastir inclines his head.
Aerocus says, "It was to be a gfit."
The sapphire-clad herald announces, "Lord Commander Murstyr Javilerre."
Lord Murstyr just came through a wide velvet-draped arch.
The sapphire-clad herald announces, "Nalfein Envoy, Lady Naevys Eilstina."
Lady Naevys just came through a wide velvet-draped arch.
Teveriel faces Murstyr and smartly brings his right fist up to his chest. Holding it there, he bows deeply.
Kothos extends open hands while gracefully scraping his right leg behind to lean forward in a subtle bow of esteem to Naevys.
The sapphire-clad herald announces, "Loenthran Envoy, Lord Eruien Lithavir."
Lord Eruien just came through a wide velvet-draped arch.
Kothos flashes a quick grin at Eruien.
You smile at Eruien.
Missoni smiles at Eruien.
Kothos performs a bow characteristic of Ta'Faendryl before Eruien.
You see Lord Eruien Lithavir Loenthra the Living Canvas and Most Esteemed Representative of Ta'Loenthra.
He appears to be an Elf.
He is tall and has a lithe body. He appears to be young and robust. He has subtly tilted, azure-flecked sea green eyes and unlined pale skin. He has shoulder-length, silky ginger hair braided around the crown in twisting triple-plaits, the weave interspersed with beleria-cut amethysts. He has a long, softly angled face, a straight nose and broad shoulders. Tiny jade leaves and arathiel moths adorn the curves and points of his ears, the minuscule jewelry strung together by draping filaments of vaalin.
He is in good shape.
He is wearing a tailored white silk jacket backed in graduating moth cutouts, an ornately floriated ataela waistcoat dyed in watercolored pastels over a flare-collared greyish violet linen shirt, a live-edge aeunarad signet worn on the right pinky, a slim pair of leather pants split with jade lace panels from hip to ankle, and some glossy two-toned brogues with lace-layered vamps.
The sapphire-clad herald announces, "Lord Gilenir Veythorne and Lord Ionlas Chesylrae.
Lord Gilenir's group just came through a wide velvet-draped arch.
Ionlas glances at Gilenir.
You see Lady Naevys Eilstina the Representative of the Rose Throne.
She appears to be a Nalfein Elf.
She is taller than average and has a balletic body. She appears to be of full age. She has kohl-outlined pale celadon green eyes and unblemished ivory skin. She has hip-length, lustrous pearlescent white hair bound in a side-chignon behind her right ear, the length pierced by fan slats of jade-washed resaeun. She has an angular face and a slender torso. Her full lips are carefully brushed with a faint gloss.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing a resaeun-braced gorget of moth-inked naevela panels, a web-like knitted needle lace wrap scattered with shards of jade-tinted arathiel with a back-cut gown of greyish violet silk caught by a duo of branch-sculpted leather sleeves underneath, a kelyn-crafted signet gracing the right pinky finger, and some semi-sheer pale tulle sandals perched on heartleaf-entwined heels.
Speaking in Elven to Gilenir, Ionlas whispers aloud, "I do not know why we had to be announced together."
You see Lord Gilenir Veythorne Illistim.
He appears to be an Elf.
He is taller than average and has a muscular, able-bodied physique. He appears to be in the spring of life. He has vibrant hazel green eyes and tanned skin. He has shoulder-length, tousled ashen blonde hair loosely knotted by a length of tanned leather. He has an angular face and well-defined cheekbones.
He is in good shape.
He is wearing a bee-embroidered cravat of sky blue-colored silk, a garden-motif brushed suede waistcoat caught with walnut buttons over a dove grey satin shirt subtly stitched in branch-like patterns, a suede chain draped across the front pocket of the brushed suede waistcoat, some well-pressed mahogany ruhani wool trousers, and a pair of tanned leather brogues with pearl-scattered toes.
You see Lord Ionlas Chesylrae Illistim.
He appears to be an Elf.
He is shorter than average and has a slim body. He appears to be in the bloom of youth. He has dark-ringed pale blue eyes and fair skin. He has long, two-toned whitish blonde hair gathered into a loose, reverse fishtail braid that cascades down his back, the pleats woven with sprigs of lace florets. He has a round face, a slightly upturned nose and delicately angled, androgynous features. A wash of watercolored pigments highlights his temples, the haze of powder flecked with gilt foil.
He is in good shape.
He is wearing a periwinkle chiffon half-cape draped from a corset-laced suede gorget, a vaalin-boned silk cincher painted in pastel-washed butterflies over a sleeveless ivory dimity shirt ruffled with tatted lace, some bicep-caught satin ribbon sleeves latticeworked down to the hands, a nacre-channeled signet of filament-caged ivory, a pair of loose pleated silk trousers with folded cuffs, and a pair of lace-strapped sandals adorned with pearl-beaded appliques.
Eruien glances between Ionlas and Gilenir.
Speaking in Elven, Teveriel pleasantly greets, "My lords."
Speaking to Ionlas, Gilenir whispers aloud, "Because he forgets which one of us is which."
The sapphire-clad herald announces, "Lady Ardtin Greyvael."
Lady Ardtin slowly enters the chamber, leaning on her cane as she and Ryossa take their places within the crowd.
Teveriel gazes respectfully at Ardtin.
Lissaya nods politely at Ryossa.
Kothos casually observes the area as he traces small circles beneath his pectoral.
Teveriel extends open hands while gracefully scraping his right leg behind to lean forward in a subtle bow of esteem to Ardtin.
Rioja sketches a bow to Ryossa, her movements a harmonious blend of human vigor and elven grace.
You see Ardtin Greyvael Illistim the Lady Councillor of Thrones.
She appears to be an Elf.
She is slight in stature. She appears to be venerable. She has clouded, pale blue eyes and fair, though aged skin. She has long, fine sterling hair meticulously brushed back into high chignon, the style haloed by amethyren-cut petals. She has a refined, high cheekboned architecture to her face and a slender, tapered pair of pointed ears.
She is in good shape.
She is holding a formidable glossy vaalorn stick with peacock-hued veilsylk braided about its shaft in her left hand.
She is wearing a high-arcing collar of parchment-crafted moths set on stiff chiffon, a haon-beaded knitted ecru silk shawl, a coat-styled lilac twill gown caught with pale lace-appliqued sleeves, and a pair of lavender needle lace ankle-boots laced with flora-burnt velvet ribbons.
Eruien bows to Ardtin.
You see Ryossa.
She appears to be a Burghal Gnome of the Winedotter Bloodline.
She is shorter than average and has a dainty-sized body. She appears to be very young. She has vibrant greenish teal eyes and tanned skin. She has glossy, curly sable hair lightly brushed back into a ribbon-braided bun decorated in tiny clockwerke-winged butterflies. She has a heart-shaped face and a tiny knick marring her right cheek.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing a brass-chained necket of embroidered silk panels, an airy knitted pale daffodil lace shrug, an off-shoulder dress of feather-traced cloudsilk pinned with a gilded peahen, an engraved gold thimble, a harp-stitched vanilla tapestry bag, and a pair of pinion-clasped buttercup suede sandals.
Aeriadrn nods to a herald positioned by the velvet-draped arch, the blonde-haired elf ushering in a member of the Sapphire Guard.
The guardsman stands silent for a moment before raising a beribboned trumpet to his lips, the reverberating fanfare echoing across the stone walls as he steps back, lowering his instrument to his side.
The sapphire-clad herald announces, "Lady Myasara and Mirror Incumbent, Lady Sayilla Javilerre."
The herald bows as the two women enter arm-in-arm, the duo approaching the Peacock Throne. They stop as they reach the steps, turning to face the audience as Sayilla steps forward with a subtle inhalation of breath.
You see Argent Mirror Myasara Illistim, her Illumination.
Myasara is surrounded by attendants, and a group of Sapphire Guards stands at attention nearby.
She is an Elf. She has large, faintly tilted grey eyes and luminous, though pale, skin. She has long, glossy auburn hair twisted away from her face by gradually draped loops of imflass chains, her temples graced by arcs of lacquered peacock feathers. The planes of her cheekbones and the tips of her ears are both sharply slanted, giving her an angular quality.
She is wearing a filament-bound gorget of watercolor-washed ribbons, a pastel painted silk gown draped from a single sleeve of embroidered auroralaen, a full-finger aureate thumb signet, and some pale-marbled starsilk sandals lofted on leaf-wrapped heels.
You see Lady Sayilla Javilerre Illistim.
She appears to be an Elf.
She is petite and has a delicately lithe build. She appears to be young. She has slightly tilted pale green eyes and fair skin. She has long, glossy copper hair braided along her crown in loosely knotted lacebark ribbons, her plaits interspersed with tiny arathiel-winged butterflies. She has an oval face, a classical nose and upswept pointed ears.
She is in good shape.
She is wearing an asymmetric gorget of lace-cut feathers extending down the right shoulder, a soft knitted leaf-patterned midnight blue pashmina shawl, a diaphanous blue-violet silk chiton cascading into a gradient of twilight-colored chiffon, a pastel-washed vaalin signet, a book-shaped pale leather case, and some laceworked leather sandals adorned with vellum-crafted wisteria.
Aeriadrn formally states, "The Mirror Incumbent would first like to address the rescue and return of Lady Ardtin Greyvael and Miss Ryossa."
Teveriel glances between Myasara and Sayilla.
Teveriel extends open hands while gracefully scraping his right leg behind to lean forward in a subtle bow of esteem.
Kothos bows respectfully before Sayilla, his eyes fixed firmly on the ground.
Sayilla sincerely states, "Without the dedicated efforts of several intrepid adventurers, I feared that we would never have our kin returned safely to the Shining City."
Sayilla says, "Simply put, we are indebted to the brave individuals who continued to search and continued to hope, and in the end were paramount in their rescue."
Sayilla smiles slightly as she nods her head towards Ardtin.
Wylnar says, "You're welcome."
Perigourd glances warily at Wylnar.
Missoni surreptitiously glances at Wylnar.
A pained expression crosses Lissaya's face.
Wylnar folds his hands behind his back.
You narrow your eyes.
Teveriel glances sternly at Wylnar.
Ardtin measuredly says, "We were informed of the efforts undertaken in our rescue, as well as what occurred since my abduction."
Ardtin says, "The gratitude of House Greyvael does not truly suffice, though I hope to return this kindness tenfold to our rescuers, and to all those who endured this past tumultuous year."
Ardtin steps back as she fluidly dips down into a graceful curtsy, rising carefully as she nods.
Sayilla sincerely says, "Lady Greyvael and Ryossa's return has revitalized us, truly."
Sayilla places her hand upon her heart, nodding her head once towards Ryossa as she gazes back up towards the audience.
Ryossa blushes profusely as she attempts to conceal herself behind Ardtin.
You see Wylnar the Mercenary.
He appears to be a Half-Elf from Ta'Vaalor.
He is average height and has a lithesome, nimble build. He appears to be an adult. He has kohl-lined jade green eyes and ghostly pale skin. He has waist-length, silken white blonde hair threaded sparsely with leather beads and left to flow freely over his broad shoulders. He has an angular face, a scar-crossed, straight nose and subtly pointed ears.
He is in good shape.
He is wearing a vivid pink jacquard jacket worked in a bold floral pattern, a black satin vest sharply tailored to a narrow waist over a flare-collared onyx cambric shirt with rose quartz chameleon cufflinks, a niello silver signet worn on the right pinky, a snug pair of night-dark suede pants buttoned diagonally across the hip, and a pair of polished ebon leather boots with sculpted silver toe caps.
Sayilla formally says, "Through many a discussion these past few months, we of the past and future Argent Throne declare that all burghal gnomes be allowed to sign our ledgers as full-fledged citizens of the Shining City. The peoples of Ta'Illistim have long depended on their skills, knowledge, and innovations in our day-to-day lives, and we in turn hope that this gesture honors that dedication."
Aerocus says, "I cooked fish for the occasion."
Murstyr glances sharply at Aerocus.
Ardtin places her on Ryossa's shoulder, giving it a slightly squeeze as she taps her stick down in approval.
Sayilla mentions, "We also bestow the invitation of partial citizenship to the forest gnomes, following in the footsteps of our cousins in Ta'Vaalor. We hope this is only the beginning of our revitalization of the city and a step forward into a bright future for Ta'Illistim."
Sayilla flashes a brief smile at the audience before turning to Aeriadrn, nodding once at the Seneschal.
Aeriadrn formally states, "The Mirror Incumbent would like to address the continued search for Lord Nellereune."
The audience begins to murmur to themselves, the whispers abruptly cut short as Sayilla raises her hand.
Sayilla says, "We thank our cousins of the fortress for their continued search for young Lord Nellereune. We do not doubt that your efforts will have him returned to us hale and whole and we continue to offer our full support in this endeavor."
Speaking politely to Wylnar, Sayilla says, "And your updates are paramount as well, if you feel inclined to share them."
Wylnar nods graciously to Sayilla, and takes one step forward toward her.
(Elaejia folds her hands before her, lips pursed.)
Wylnar says, "Although progress has been slower than I would have preferred due to a particular distaste for the sea and its distaste for me..."
Speaking to Sayilla, Wylnar continues, "I have been able to significantly narrow down the locations in which Twit, as he is so fondly called, has been traveling, and I have been tracking his movements as he and his... newfound companions seek out a particular treasure of note."
(Heartfire listens intently to Wylnar trying to catch up, but yet hanging on every word from his mouth.)
Speaking to Sayilla, Wylnar adds, "I say with the utmost confidence, and I would like to express that I already have an excessive amount of confidence in myself, or so I am told--"
Speaking monotonously to Wylnar, Heartfire asks, "Say that again, with more confidence?"
Khobra examines Wylnar closely, sizing him up and taking note of all the details.
Speaking to Sayilla, Wylnar continues, "That I will have him returnd by the end of the weekend. Or, if not myself, someone in this very room. I believe we all know where Twit will be haunting this weekend and it is doubtful we would be unable to bring him in."
Sayilla says, "The swathe of destruction that this pirate band has brought upon the Eastern Seaboard must be stopped if we are to continue our support of our kin of the fortress, and those along the coast."
Heartfire agrees with Sayilla.
Sayilla simply says, "We hope to see Twi-"."
Sayilla quickly corrects, "Young Lord Nellerune returned to the Shining City."
Aeriadrn readjusts his stance as he observes the crowd.
Aeriadrn formally states, "We shall address the question of the Mirror Incumbent."
Myasara subtly gazes at Ardtin and nods in acknowledgement as Ryossa tilts up to whisper into her ear.
Sayilla softly says, "I have spent these last few months visiting many of the established families of the Shining City, sharing stories and listening to their concerns regarding the future of Illistim."
Ionlas whispers something to Gilenir.
Sayilla continues, "I spoke at length to Myasara and Lady Greyvael of my aspirations for our city-state, and to Seneschal Aeriadrn of the ambitions I have for all of our peoples."
Sayilla amusedly says, "I also dedicated myself to speaking to whoever would grant me an audience, persistently requesting to assist the maidservants with their daily work, following the young Sapphire Guard recruits as they redirected the peahens, and engrossing myself in learning more about the visitors who enter through our portcullis."
Sayilla smiles softly to herself before returning her gaze to the audience.
Sayilla clearly states, "I understand that my youth comes with naivety, and with that naivety comes doubt."
Murstyr gazes fondly at Sayilla.
Sayilla earnestly says, "But I entreat you all to place your faith in me, in Illistim."
Sayilla confidently says, "Inspired by your stories of cooperation, teamwork against impossible odds, camaraderie and hope, I am announcing the creation of two councils that will assist me as we enter into this new age of progressive change while also honoring the traditions and stories of the past."
Sayilla states, "The first council will consist of members from the Houses Avelleur, Chesylrae, Greyvael, Nellereune, Veythorne, as well as envoys from Ardenai, Loenthra, Nalfein, and Vaalor."
Sayilla quickly quips, "I had suggested the name The Wisteria Council but a certain Lord audibly groaned out of instinct."
Sayilla amusedly murmurs, "There can only be one Tree Whisperer, after all."
Sayilla kindly explains, "There are several symbolic interpretations for wisteria, and I amusingly find it apt that a single flower can represent so many hopes I have for our city-state."
Sayilla simply says, "Longevity, kindness, transformation, and resilience."
Eruien nods slightly at Kothos.
Sayilla formally announces, "Our second council will be comprised of members spanning all races of Elanthia, representatives that we hope bring unique perspectives, histories, and culture to the Shining City. If we are to be a beacon of culture, of progression, then we must share our light with others and hope they do so in return."
Sayilla warmly says, "We invite all to join us in this journey, and it is my sincere hope to revitalize the chanceries to provide a familiar taste of home."
Sayilla firmly states, "I want to emphasize that all voices should be heard, regardless of citizenship or familial ties, and that the implementation of both councils will afford unique perspectives to ensure we provide for all who live and thrive within our walls."
Myasara announces, "Once we have established these councils, the formal coronation of Sayilla Javilerre will take place in Imaerasta. Myself and Lady Greyvael will comprise the Council of Thrones to be mentors to our Incumbent Mirror and do hereby nominate her to be coronated the next Argent Mirror."
Ardtin taps her stick firmly across the ground in quick succession.
Speaking politely to Sayilla, Ardtin mentions, "And I have more than my share of opinions, Lady Javilerre."
Aeriadrn formally announces, "Before the Mirror Incumbent opens the floor for petitions, we have an announcement from Lord Gilenir Veythorne."
Teveriel glances expectantly at Gilenir.
Ionlas raises an eyebrow in Gilenir's direction.
Gilenir sheepishly informs, "The preparations for the Day of the Wandering Artist are going as planned, though Sayi-the Mirror Incumbent had suggested we delay the festivities until the twentieth and twenty-first of Koaratos to allow guests from the West ample time to traverse across the Dragonspine."
Gilenir continues, "The gardens of Veythorne Manor and the artwork will be prepared for the official holiday on the thirteenth, though The Wisteria Markets will be delayed until the week after, giving everyone time to enjoy the artwork and florals properly. Market stalls will be permitted to be set up through the perimeter of the Veythorne Manor, though we request that we keep the garden area clear as to not disturb the artwork within."
Gilenir quickly concludes, "That was all I had to say, thank you for your time and we look forward to seeing you all in the upcoming weeks."
Gilenir bows low to Sayilla, then Myasara, then continues before someone politely pulls him upright.
Gilenir whispers something to Ionlas.
Ionlas nods at Gilenir.
Aeriadrn formally says, "Now that all official announcements have been made, we will now hear petitions from those assembled."
Aerocus says, "I repersent voice of giantkin."
Speaking formally to Aerocus, Aeriadrn asks, "Do you wish to relay your petition to the Mirror Incumbent?"
Aerocus says, "I bought gift of freshy cook trout."
Speaking formally to Sayilla, Aeriadrn says, "A petition from... this gentleman."
Heartfire removes a honey-glazed rat-on-a-stick from in his bearskin pouch.
Heartfire offers Aerocus a honey-glazed rat-on-a-stick.
Speaking amusedly to Aerocus, Sayilla says, "You have the floor then, sir."
Murstyr glances sternly at Heartfire.
Aerocus accepts Heartfire's honey-glazed rat-on-a-stick.
Heartfire monotonously asks, "What'd I do?"
Heartfire monotonously says, "I was jes... helping him.. .I'm sorry."
Heartfire nods gratefully at Murstyr.
Teveriel places one hand up to his forehead, partially covering his face and shaking his head.
Aerocus says, "I also have afffilation with...other clans, I have man one who works to bring honesty, and forge trust."
Aerocus says, "Bare with me my common is not great."
Aerocus says, "I am nenw to the shinning city, I have arrive about a week ago to learn."
Speaking warmly to Aerocus, Sayilla replies, "Well-met sir, I do hope to bolster relations with the giantkin as we continue to open our gates to new experiences and forge new bonds."
Aerocus says, "The complex history of the elves is confusing to outsidsiders, all signs are in elveish. I purpose a simple rules guide upon entrance to the shinnin city."
Aerocus says, "Othen then that I have nothing more at this time, thank you."
Aerocus heavily pounds both his fists against his chest and bows his head slightly.
You see Lord Heartfire Durden the Myrmidon.
He appears to be a Giantman of the T'Kirem Clan.
He is taller than average. He appears to be young and robust. He has long-lashed dark sea blue eyes and tanned skin. He has unevenly cut, dark blonde hair that fades to a lighter hue near the tips. He has an angular face and brawny shoulders. He has a faint shadow of stubble which adds further definition to his jawline.
He has a mutilated tattoo of mangled flesh on his forearm, and a tattooed alphabetic lexicon on his wrist.
He has a fractured and bleeding right leg, some minor cuts and bruises on his right hand, minor cuts and bruises on his chest, minor cuts and bruises on his abdominal area, and some minor cuts and bruises on his left arm.
He is bleeding from the right leg.
He is wearing a gem-inset vaalin bracelet, a pair of pressed ebon wool trousers with crooked creases, an oiled black leather belt smudged with prints of polish, some ruby-eyed silver skull earrings, some sleek cobra skin gauntlets covered with zorchar studs, some smooth viper skin shoes with zorchar-dusted toes, some battered rolaren full plate with a fitted black cotton shirt lightly stained with blood underneath, a tattered and torn warrior's greatcloak, a rugged bearskin pouch spattered with blood, a blackened spiked mithglin aventail, some blood-red ruby cufflinks, a golvern-bound vruul skin badge, a scorched black zombie scalp baldric fringed with talons and claws slung over his shoulder, a travel-worn chestnut suede haversack with mismatched leather patches, some blackened mithril arm greaves, a void black crystal-inset ring, a patch-worked kit crafted from scraggly hides, a heavy black linen harness embroidered with swans in flight, and some blackened mithril leg greaves.
You see Aerocus the Bounty Hunter.
He appears to be a Giantman of the T'Kirem Clan.
Drawn up over his head is a dark leather hood, the edge partially shading his features. Plush wolverine fur lines the interior of the hood, the black-tipped silver pelt framing his face.
He is average height. He appears to have come of age. He has feral misty green eyes and tanned skin. He has a shaven head of coal black hair swept back from the temples. He has a square-jawed face, a flaring nose and deep laugh lines.
He has crisp white feathers painted on his face accompanied by a bright yellow nose.
He has a chain of cheeky monkeys tattoo on his neck, a square fishing net tattoo on his wrist, a skull and crossbones tattoo on his wrist, and a squat-faced fishing cat tattoo on his neck.
He is in good shape.
He is holding some seared trout seasoned with coconuts and flathead mushrooms in his right hand and a honey-glazed rat-on-a-stick in his left hand.
He is wearing a dragon blood bark amulet, a black grizzly fur-lined cloak, a sinuous ruic longbow suffused with argent undertones slung over his shoulder, a ring-bound iron grey leather bandolier over a mottled vultite coat-of-plates with turtle shell pauldrons, a cross-wrapped bistre leather shirt, a set of articulated steel gauntlets buckled down the forearms, a narrow platinum band traced with a repeating pattern of hooked thorns, a gilt-knuckled set of vert cloisonne finger-armor, a neutral-toned pouch of diamond-scaled rattlesnake skin, an ora-handled fishing net stained with pallid sanguine blood, a shaggy dark grey wolf fur satchel, a plaid pleated kilt with a silver dagger pin, and a pair of gradient knitted fish-patterned blue tweed socks under a pair of rugged climbing boots.
Aerocus glances uneasily around the room.
Speaking thoughtfully to Aerocus, Sayilla says, "I had not considered how confusing it must be to come upon such, but I will address it with the builders. Thank you for sharing your suggestion."
Sayilla smiles at Aerocus.
Wylnar gives a sidelong glance at Teveriel.
Wylnar flashes a quick grin at Teveriel.
Teveriel glances sternly at Wylnar.
Aeriadrn formally asks, "Are there any others who would like to petition the Mirror Incumbent?"
Wylnar adjusts the chameleon cufflink on his right sleeve.
Speaking formally to Sayilla, Aeriadrn says, "We have another petition."
You close your eyes for a moment.
Lissaya begins to twitch.
Sayilla nods in greeting at Khobra.
Teveriel kneads at his forehead with the redoubtable fingers of one hand, his expression transitioning from exasperation to forced neutrality.
Khobra smiles while slowly approaching no closer than the bottom step of the rostrum in the Argentate.
Khobra bows her head slightly as she drops into a deep, respectful curtsy.
As Khobra rubs her black diamond ring, a spark of rosy red electricity builds in her right hand.
Speaking humbly in Faendryl to Myasara, Khobra greets something you don't understand.
Khobra's sanguine cloud of electricity in her hand pulses brighter red and dimmer red in succession.
Speaking humbly to Myasara, Khobra says, "Salutations to the reflection of beauty regarding your people and society, "Illistim's Argent Mirror."
Speaking humbly to Myasara, Khobra continues, "I am but with three questions I would like responded to if the Argent Reflection selects to answer any question."
Khobra tilts her head down.
Arbeia takes a moment to observe Khobra.
Speaking warmly to Myasara, Khobra inquires, "My first of three questions, Argent Mirror. I have read, through recorded history, you are not wedded. People believed you suitable for their Lord Commander, I believe their term - yet could be mistaken. Do you, Argent Mirror, intend to wed again?"
Speaking politely to Khobra, Myasara says, "You may ask any of your questions, though you would do better to address the Mirror Incumbent."
Eruien clenches his jaw, gazing up at the vaulted ceiling and its mosaic.
Teveriel raises his eyebrows and gazes quite intently at Myasara, clearly withholding comment.
Speaking to Myasara, Sayilla asks, "Do you intend to marry yourself off now?"
Speaking thoughtfully to Sayilla, Myasara says, "I hadn't had any intentions of doing so in the near future, though I will contemplate your offer."
Speaking formally to Khobra, Sayilla responds, "Neither myself nor Lady Myasara have plans on nuptials."
Speaking innocently to Sayilla, Khobra states, "Much has been learned from learning something unknown from our past. No matter how dark, light, chaotic, lawful good, or evil it may seem or be - something was learned."
Speaking softly to Sayilla, Khobra requests, "A great deal of things was learned when returning to a place others called new, strange, or uncanny yet I call home, Maelshyve. I request we return to Maelshyve."
You furrow your brow, probably adding a wrinkle or two in the process.
Speaking humbly to Sayilla, Khobra continues, "Last time we visited Maelshyve we collected veil iron and black ora, both important parts of history. I know another part of black ora and veil iron, history, to be found there, and if there is may I study the black ora relic before it is taken to be locked within your Halls vaults?"
Speaking firmly to Khobra, Sayilla asks, "I beg your pardon?"
Khobra's rubicund cloud of electricity in her hand pulses brighter red and dimmer red in succession.
Speaking softly to Sayilla, Khobra says, "I am asking to return back to Maelshyve."
(Teveriel glances sharply at Wylnar and opens his mouth to speak, then snaps it shut.)
Arbeia says, "Oh erm."
Arbeia says, "Pardon me."
(Teveriel gives Wylnar a curt nod of concession.)
Khobra's ball of scarlet lightning shrinks and grows in her hand.
Speaking carefully to Khobra, Sayilla says, "Your request has been given and will be considered at a time when we have the resources to do so."
Speaking humbly to Sayilla, Khobra requests, "To return to Maelshyve also requires collecting insects and plants there that can be found in NO other place but Maelshyve. Some experiments with insects and plants collected may lead to healing or poisoning reactions but that is based on the experiments."
Khobra humbly concludes, "My humblest of thank for your time."
Speaking politely to Khobra, Sayilla responds, "Thank you for your petition."
Wylnar steps to the right.
Aeriadrn formally asks, "Are there any other petitioners?"
Aeriadrn formally says, "We have concluded the hearing of petitions."
Aeriadrn formally concludes, "The formal session has concluded, we thank all who traveled to the Shining City."
Wylnar slips into the crowd.
Speaking to Ryossa, Ardtin asks, "Do you think Thimwi has that tea I enjoy? With the gin?"
Ryossa grabs Ardtin's hand.
Ryossa's group just went through a wide velvet-draped arch.
