<p>Held on 1/19/2024
</p><p>Hosted by GM Kenstrom
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Testing testing 1 2 3."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Perfect."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Alright, I'll go over some "ideas" I have slated for 2024. Subject to change for a variety of reasons, but, a framework."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Then we'll dive into questions."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Be civil, kind, and xoxo."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "So fa for Q1, I've updated some of the bazaar shops tha needed fixed, rolled out 2 town council offices, the krolvin refugee settlement, and coming in the next few weeks will be the Regional Envoy shops for Thrassus and Tikba."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "And a new envoy area in moot hall."
</p><p>Tikba says, "Please don't sell me in a shop."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "The Albatross is also now permanently open in the Landing."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "So, get you game on."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "There's also 2 new Landing shops coming in the next few weeks, details will be revealed later."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I'm working on finally making a new Mayor's office, which I hadn't made since PC Mayors. But figured I finally need one for my NPCs."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "In the spring I'm hoping to announce a player contest (details coming, so many secrets), and a regular schedule for Landing Citizenship Raffles."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I'm also working on some script ideas for new town defense systems, primarily for invasions and to help all level ranges, and also a Locksmehr River travel system for the region."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Initial design stages on both, so don't expect much details yet."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I also want to overhall the Festival of Frost grounds and games and bring it back this holiday season."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "And I've got two new lore documents in the work, Blood and Sun, which will focus on blood magic, its various origins, uses, history, impact, etc but with more of a focus on the western side of the world, and also an imperial holiday and festival document."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "We'll also be wrapping up North by Northwest in Feb/March-ish, and then I'm working on a storyline idea closer to end of the year but can't reveal much yet."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Gotta keep some mystery or you'll break up with me."
</p><p>Kenstrom snickers.
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Now then!"
</p><p>Kenstrom indicates a jumbo list as a possible option.
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Join the list if you want to ask a question!"
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Lylia!"
</p><p>Speaking to Kenstrom, Lylia accuses, "You stole all my thunder when you talked about town improvements; that's exactly what I was going to ask about."
</p><p>Lylia grins.
</p><p>Lylia says, "So instead, I'll ask about whether we can hope to see more integration with other towns a la Nations on the Brink and other world story events."
</p><p>Lylia adds, "And to return to those town improvements for a minute: if possible or feasible, could we help build some stuff? Contribute to festival design? Offer suggestions for the town? Like a statue, maybe...?"
</p><p>Lylia says, "The boutique is very 5121."
</p><p>Speaking to Lylia, you ask, "A bleakstone statue?"
</p><p>Kenstrom asks, "A..bleakstone statue?"
</p><p>You giggle at Kenstrom.
</p><p>Lylia says, "We already have a perfectly good statue. Yes. It just needs to be installed in the right spot."
</p><p>Kenstrom asks, "Can you elaborate more on your idea of integration with other towns?"
</p><p>Lylia says, "Sure! I know there are story things planned for the next year that will be more world-changing, though of course we don't know what it'll look like until it unfolds."
</p><p>Lylia asks, "But going back to NotB, the Landing was kind of on the periphery a little, which is understandable -- off on the frontier and all -- but wondering if we would have a nice-sized slice of that sweet sweet intrigue action?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I fully expect town overlap with storylines and developments, with still a healthy focus on local aspects too."
</p><p>Lylia exclaims, "Sounds good!"
</p><p>Lylia says, "And if you want some work on the boutique, I know some people..."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Yes, I would like to run some contests, design ideas, etc to help expand on some things in town, new and revised."
</p><p>Lylia exclaims, "Thanks -- I look forward to this!"
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Irval!"
</p><p>Irval asks, "Hey, Was hoping to get your thoughts on the potentional for a new hunting area , exactly like you did with the Reivers  and the ember vale, but a permanent fixture.  Possible ideas Ive heard mentioned would be cool, Obelisk under Darkstone bay, Or a new wing or area to darkstone. I for one would like there to be that choice of a capped level area for landing. Anyways, your thoughts?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "There is capped hunting in Wehnimer's Landing. You're just the ones being hunted."
</p><p>Irval pokes Kenstrom in the ribs.
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I've been wanting capped hunting in the Landing for a very, very long time, and have several ideas. I wish I could say more one way or the other, but I would love it just as much as you. Wish I could say more."
</p><p>Irval says, "Tease."
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Vaemyr!"
</p><p>Vaemyr says, "Well I was gonna ask about invasion stuff but you mentioned that... so."
</p><p>Vaemyr asks, "Are we ever gonna get like storyline improvements to the town like stone walls and such?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "That's tough, for a few reasons."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I've gone back and forth on town "growth".
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "And not in the sense of new shops but like..."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Stone walls, things like that."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Does it make the town lose its frontier charm and appearance? Is it a huge undertaking to update a crap ton of room descriptions..."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Will people complain and be all like #teampalisade #teamstonebutnotgrishomstone."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Yah, suspension of belief with the imperial encampment walls. Perigourd built those in like 2 hours."
</p><p>Kenstrom snickers.
</p><p>Vaemyr says, "Yeah it just feels tough sometimes, with storylines seemingly that should push us to upgrade some things, like how many appocalyptic events we gotta have till we go all fortress city haha."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "But I am contemplating some upgrades to the town, that support the natural progression of stories, of time, of progress, but still respects the spirit of the town."
</p><p>Vaemyr says, "Not that I'd like things to go that far, but it'd be nice to see some type of progess stuff."
</p><p>Kenstrom asks, "Ta'Landing?"
</p><p>Kenstrom peers quizzically at Vaemyr.
</p><p>Kenstrom snickers.
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Part of my town defense ideas include workable gates."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "And like, log traps or log placement to close off streets to invaders, etc."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "And more for lower levels to do."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I'm also having the ballista system and pylons revisited."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I did for awhile, but then crazy people would fire on players during non invasions."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "It'd also be a nice thought if town militia can do certain things."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Like, unlocking ballista."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "After NxNW, I'm going to take a storyline break to really focus on some expansion and facelift stuff."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "When I'm in full storyline mode, it's hard to do some of those things."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Well, there will still be RP and NPC stuff I do."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I just mean, no bookend storyline."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Until closer to end of 2024."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Like, for example, after 14 months of Cross into Shadows, I didn't do a "beginning to end" storyline for like a year. But I did lots of NPC stuff, small town plot stuff, etc during that time."
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Stormyrain!"
</p><p>Stormyrain asks, "Speaking of..storyline progression and Grishom Stone. Is there still a plan to finish his story in the --near future?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Grishom died off stage. The end."
</p><p>Kenstrom snickers.
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Yes, Threads of Heaven is still planned and being plotted."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I'm still so damn tired."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "How do you all stay up so late..."
</p><p>Kenstrom snickers.
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Kiyna!"
</p><p>You say, "I'm aware this is something you're working on, but inquiring Rooks want to know! Do you have any timeframe in mind for the Parliament? I assume that's post-NxNW stuff. It is kind of a relatively minor event in comparison to current events, haha. Just thought I'd fish for an update."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Yes, I'm working on some Parliament of Rooks things, it has been slower simply because yeah, Rooks were a heavy focus in Chap 2, not so much in Chap 3. More like a cooling period. I would expect a trickle perhaps, but really more post-NxNW."
</p><p>You ask, "Makes sense to me. Also, when can I get me one of Underhill's human-size mecha for halflings?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "There will be several post-NXNW I'll be working on."
</p><p>Kenstrom starts chuckling at you!
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Faiyth!"
</p><p>Speaking to Kenstrom, Faiyth asks, "Super exciting what you have in store for the town improvements. Lylia asked the majority of my question about wheather there would be an improvements or revamps for the existing shops/stores. How about any additions of alteration sweatshop type areas like are being released elsewhere?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Oh yes."
</p><p>Kenstrom asks, "The ones that like, emblazon stuff, carve patterns, etc?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "That's one of the shops coming to the bazaar. I just wasn't sure if the other shops were open yet in other towns. So I didn't want to give anything away."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "But yes, Whittle and Weave is coming soon."
</p><p>Faiyth applauds Kenstrom.
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Tikba!"
</p><p>Tikba says, "Uh I am sad that NxNW is wrapping up so soon, but looking forward to whatever comes next."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I mean, let's just be honest..."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "NxNW was originally billed as 3 months."
</p><p>Kenstrom asks, "We're what...14 months in now?"
</p><p>Kenstrom chuckles.
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I've got a rough idea for when it'll end-ish, but subject to change."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I also want to coordinate it properly around Duskruin, and Disneyland."
</p><p>Tikba asks, "Since Vaemyr took my stone walls question I will just say it is super helpful for my life planning when you let us know in advance when KST is coming and is there any way we could get more of that?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "To be clear, I'm going to Disneyland in March. Gemstone is not getting Disneyland."
</p><p>Kenstrom laughs!
</p><p>Kenstrom asks, "Wavedancer converted into a Disney cruise?"
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Someone tell Wyrom!"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Yes, I would love some more...advance KST. I will try to get it more stabilized."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "My work is keeping me very very busy, I haven't even had the drive to write in two months. So sometimes that makes me super exhausted at night, but yes, I want some more...stability night wise."
</p><p>Tikba nods appreciatively at Kenstrom.
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Donteric!"
</p><p>Donteric says, "To push on a notion raised earlier: IF Darkstone is to become more than a camp, at some point, would be neat and potentially fun story development for that to come with, possibly trigger  some new hunting grounds being developed or discovered in or surrounding the castle. Just a thought- and it would certainly flow with the idea of the region becoming a bit more complicated."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "To be continued Sir Donteric."
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Khirem!"
</p><p>Khirem quietly says, "Ana thoughts o a path ta my homeland, Kilnarij? other races have stationary homes. that is the closest the giantkin have."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "That's more of a giantman race question."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I'm Landing, humans, and your deeds."
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Lylia2!"
</p><p>Lylia asks, "Thought of another one! Any possibility of rethinking Frontier Days or something like it? Maybe a regional festival that incorporates Krolvin, Vaaloran, and Imperial wares as we have all three of those with interests near the Landing?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Yes."
</p><p>Lylia turns to Kenstrom and cheers!
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I have been debating another Landing festival. It wouldn't be annual."
</p><p>Lylia says, "Good! I really loved it and have missed it. Delighted to hear there's something in the works. Doesn't have to be annual to be amazing."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I think my original idea was...I can't even remember the name."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Witch something. Like, a celebration of defeating Raznel."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Eh, works is a stretch. Tossing around some ideas for now."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "But short answer yes I'm open to it and have been toying with some ideas."
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Geijon!"
</p><p>Geijon mentions, "Kenstrom Can I get you on record that you have tested non-OHE 8x weapons such as Stonebreaker, my maul and coraesine weapons or similar powerful weaponry will hit Vathors? I'd like to not flip tables when I can't hit them in a death sentance situation."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Um..."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Take out your weapons."
</p><p>&lt;Everyone takes out their weapons expecting Kenstrom to drop vathors on our heads&gt;
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Geijon."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Not everyone."
</p><p>Kenstrom laughs!
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I copied your maul. I'll test it later."
</p><p>Geijon renders a salute with his rune-scribed maul.
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Gutstorm!"
</p><p>Gutstorm drunkenly slurs, "What is Gutstorm's DEED counter at on your kill sheet you keep next to your PC?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "0."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I reset every night. Keep it fresh."
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Tayler!"
</p><p>Tayler says, "Errr actually my question probably isn't right for this particular forum."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Try me."
</p><p>Tayler says, "Well, you're bloodtooth bracer man, and I would very much like a script addon version of that at some point."
</p><p>Kenstrom asks, "Like add the script to other wrist things?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I'll have to look into that. Not sure what the rules are when it comes to that, etc."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "I'm also trying to contemplate a new bloodbender item too."
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Irval!"
</p><p>Irval asks, "Oh , Ok so, your invasion creatures have a boat load of hp and uncrittable. Anychance we can make them critable while keeping the HP?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Sure. Not all of them are uncrittable. But some are, yes. But I'll try to find a balance."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Might even make them all magic resistant for Lylia."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Her favorite."
</p><p>Lylia swears at Kenstrom, hissing a filth-laden denunciation in icily precise Faendryl, each syllable sharp with menace.
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "The list is empty!"
</p><p>Lylia says, "Thank you for the meeting, Kenstrom! I'm excited to see what comes down the pike next."
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Me too!"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "And...most importantly..."
</p><p>Vaemyr asks, "Buy deeds?"
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "Thanks to you all. I love playing with you, it's fun, and keeps things exciting and I love seeing it evolve even for me."
</p><p>Kenstrom says, "And yeah of course, buy deeds."
</p><p>Suddenly Kenstrom looms high above you, striking terror into your very soul!
</p><p>Kenstrom exclaims, "Goodnight everyone! Thanks for coming!"
