Faulkil says, speaking to you, "I appreciate your taking some time to meet with you."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Good evening."
</p><p>Faulkil exclaims, speaking to you, "Indeed!"
</p><p>Heavy sparks dance around Faulkil as wisps of electricity travel up and down his body.
</p><p>You see Faulkil.
</p><p>He appears to be a Dhe'nar Dark Elf.
</p><p>He is shorter than average.  He appears to be very young.  He has long-lashed dark eyes and dusky skin.  He has long, silky russet hair feathered with soft, shadowy strands.  He has a long face, a broken nose and thin lips.  He has a fake fancy fuzzy fuchsia goatee.
</p><p>He has a rune tattoo on his arm, and a rune tattoo on his arm.
</p><p>He is in good shape.
</p><p>He is wearing a floppy purple hat set with plumed griffin feathers, a knitted cashmere and amethyst scarf, a pale crystal shard, a frumpy fiery red greatcloak, some dark grey silver-insigiled casting gloves, a small bone periapt, a carved round-of-cheese locket, a silvery ora snowshoe hare stickpin, an ebon-hued obsidian gate pin, a shaggy ice blue mule pin, a faceted opalescent thunderstone charm flecked with gold, a heavy dark wool shirt with long narrow sleeves and embroidered with a snowshoe hare, an opaline snowball pin, a slit-pupiled citrine quartz pin, a lilac leather weapon harness trimmed with silver and gold, a voluminous haversack with a griffin claw clasp, a storm grey leather satchel clasped with a radiant opalescent thunderstone, a pale lavender silk-wrapped back-scabbard, some pale layered leather hunts ridged with colorful braid lacing, an etched white gold wedding band, a rune belt, a dark leather bag swept with silver sigils, a glowing-runed verdigrised bell dangling from an electrum chain, an elegant black silk gem pouch, a dusty dark red sack, some pale grey silk trousers with a slight lilac tint, and a pair of resplendent white pelt boots inset with purple thunderstones.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Wow nice office."
</p><p>[Faulkil's Office]
</p><p>Beneath an oak beam ceiling, an Elanthia map painting hangs on one of the rough plaster walls.  Some gilt kakore shelves and an ancient orase desk sit in opposite corners while a number of unopened shipping crates rests on a scraped oak floor.  You also see a beveled cedar sign.
</p><p>Also here: Faulkil
</p><p>Obvious exits: northeast
</p><p>You gaze in wonder at your surroundings.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "I find it easier to discuss matters here."
</p><p>Faulkil adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>Faulkil grins.
</p><p>Faulkil points at an Elanthia map painting.
</p><p>Faulkil says, "I am particularly fond of the artwork."
</p><p>&gt;look painting
</p><p>From afar, the map is simple, with apparently unbroken brush strokes depicting Elanthian geography.  Upon inspection, the painting reveals its secret - inked details that are numerous enough to be boggling.  The peaks of mountains are limned with precision, demonstrating where each jagged edge and the safe paths rest.  Tiny town layouts are drawn in miniscule perfection and painstakingly labeled.  Every aspect of the map shows the same level of detail, from rivers to impossibly small trees.
</p><p>&gt;cover painting
</p><p>You shouldn't mess with the Elanthia map painting.
</p><p><br/>
You quietly say, "That is truely a piece of work."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Im sorry My name is Opalina."
</p><p>Faulkil grins.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "Faulkil.  I believe we have met before but possibly I just know you by reputation."
</p><p>Faulkil grins.
</p><p>Faulkil adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>You quietly say, "It is possible I forget, I meet alot of poeple I don't mean to be rude."
</p><p>Heavy sparks dance around Faulkil as wisps of electricity travel up and down his body.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "No no.  Not rude at all.  I have similar difficulties."
</p><p>Faulkil smiles at you.
</p><p>You quietly exclaim, "So, You wanted to know more about the deligation!"
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "So.. to business I suppose. It has been some time since I have visited Ta'Vaalor.  I would welcome the excuse to visit again."
</p><p>You nod.
</p><p>Faulkil adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "I just want to make sure I can adequaltely represent the town before volunteering."
</p><p>Faulkil nods firmly.
</p><p>You quietly ask, "I can share some of what's happened and why we feel the need to send a deligation, would you mind if I sat down?"
</p><p>Faulkil exclaims, speaking to you, "Please do!"
</p><p>Faulkil sits down.
</p><p>Faulkil adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>You gaze in wonder at your surroundings.
</p><p>You sit down next to a number of unopened shipping crates.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "The floor is swept regularly.  I use it when I need to spread out a bit."
</p><p>Faulkil says, "Possibly I should consider some throw pillows or something to sit on..."
</p><p>Faulkil works his fingers under his floppy purple hat and scratches his head.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Oh the floor is fine."
</p><p>You quietly say, "I'll try to remember the best I can."
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "So yes!  Icemule is my home so if I can lend assistance that would be excellent."
</p><p>You quietly say, "There were talks between some of the folks with the mayor a few weeks back about a treaty with Ta'Vaalor."
</p><p>Faulkil ponders.
</p><p>You quietly say, "One that was made may may may may days ago."
</p><p>You quietly say, "By a different mayor."
</p><p>Faulkil asks, speaking to you, "What kind of treaty?  Trade?  Peace?  Exchange of students?"
</p><p>Faulkil grins.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Good question."
</p><p>You ponder.
</p><p>You quietly say, "From what I was reading in the history, and from what I gathered from my visit to Ta'Vaalor it is verbal agreement that allows Ta'Vaalor to pass through Icemule and its lands without hinderance."
</p><p>You quietly say, "And airspace."
</p><p>Faulkil says, "Verbal treaty..."
</p><p>Faulkil stares off into space.
</p><p>You lean forward.
</p><p>You quietly say, "There's no paperwork found so far just written testomony."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Of the happenings."
</p><p>You nod.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "Ink, quill, and parchment are the meat and potatoes of a good treaty."
</p><p>Faulkil grins.
</p><p>You agree with Faulkil.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Makes it easier to remember the facts."
</p><p>Faulkil says, "Okay... so we have some historical testimony that assert a treaty."
</p><p>You quietly say, "So.. a few weeks back airships started flying over Icemule."
</p><p>Faulkil nods.
</p><p>You quietly say, "And getting more and more frequent."
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "It seems to me that if no one can produce a parchment with an actual documented treaty... then we have an opportunity for negotiation."
</p><p>Faulkil adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>You quietly say, "This started upsetting folks and asking questions... Well.. "sighs softly" One of the councilers wrote to the mayor and the mayor called a private meetings.. which was private..so I can't discuss what happened there, But later that letter went missing and ended up in Ta'Vaalor."
</p><p>You quietly say, "The Letter... to the Mayor.."
</p><p>You cough.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "So... we have thievery or incompetence or both.  Usual politics sadly."
</p><p>Faulkil adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Was not worded in the nicest terms toward the Ta'Vaalorians if they choose to see it as a threat."
</p><p>You quietly say, "It is feared that it could cause war between our two cities."
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "Well they are techincally invading our airspace."
</p><p>Faulkil grins.
</p><p>Faulkil says, "But outright war wouldn't benefit either town."
</p><p>Faulkil ponders.
You quietly say, "With that concern, and the happenings.. The response from Ta'Vaalor was that they were opening trade with a neighboring town of ours and that we should continue to live up to what was agreed upon."
</p><p>You nod somberly.
</p><p>Faulkil asks, speaking to you, "OUtside of avoiding a war.  What is our actual objective as a town?  Reduce air travel?  Tax it?  Something else?"
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Faulkil, "See that has not been brought up! you should come to our open council meetings."
</p><p>Faulkil ponders.
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Faulkil, "Maybe it has I miss things."
</p><p>Faulkil asks, speaking to you, "Well let's start with that.  When might the next meeting be held?"
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Faulkil, "In two days."
</p><p>Faulkil adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>You quietly say, "I think."
</p><p>Faulkil grins.
</p><p>You ponder.
</p><p>Faulkil asks, speaking to you, "Two days-ish.  Evening meetings?"
</p><p>You quietly say, "To be honest Im not sure when the next Open meeting is. I'd have to ask."
</p><p>Faulkil grins.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "Is there someplace I can check up on this?  I'll do my best to attend and if it seems like something I can add value to  then I will present myself as a potential volunteer."
</p><p>Faulkil adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Ohh I can add your name to the list if your interested."
</p><p>A series of dark lines suddenly appears on Faulkil's face, quickly racing towards the center of his forehead before detaching and dissipating in the air.
</p><p>Faulkil ponders.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "Let's go with that then.  If it doesn't appear to make sense at some point I can say as such."
</p><p>You quietly say, "I know counciler Sorlu is doing interviews of each of the signupees."
</p><p>Faulkil nods firmly.
</p><p>You quietly say, "He will be asking some tough questions though."
</p><p>You nod at Faulkil.
</p><p>Faulkil says, "I don't believe I've had the pleasure.  Sounds reasonable."
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "Those are the best kinds."
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "I hope they are prepared for some tough responses."
</p><p>Faulkil grins.
</p><p>Faulkil agrees with you.
</p><p>Faulkil nods firmly.
</p><p>Faulkil says, "Sorlu."
</p><p>Faulkil says, "I will keep an eye out."
</p><p>Heavy sparks dance around Faulkil as wisps of electricity travel up and down his body.
</p><p>You quietly say, "I will let him know you are added to the list."
</p><p>You remove a frost blue parchment from in your eahnor-plated pack.
</p><p>You reach toward your ear, and the quill releases its hold on your ear.  Twining several tentacles about your fingers it shifts itself into your hand.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "Okay!  So I a tentative volunteer.  I can expect a rough interview - I'll try and stay hydrated!  And I should see about attending an open meeting in the near future.  POssibly two evenings hence."
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "Thank you so much for taking time out of your evening to speak with me."
</p><p>Faulkil adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>You nod enthusiastically!
</p><p>You stand back up.
</p><p>You dust off your plumille houppelande.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "Icemule has been good to me over the years and I would appreciate an opportunity to return some of the kindness."
</p><p>Faulkil stands up.
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Did I answer any questions?"
</p><p>Faulkil sets about preparing himself to be as presentable as possible.
</p><p>Faulkil exclaims, speaking to you, "Indeed!  Very thoroughly!"
</p><p>Faulkil bows to you.
</p><p>Faulkil says, speaking to you, "Much appreciated."
</p><p>You set your quill to your parchment and write down your thoughts to the body of the parchment.
</p><p>In the Common language, it reads:
</p><p>Icemule Deligates List
</p>
<ul><li>The Lady Elliathe of Icemule.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Faulkil</li></ul>
<p>You gaze in wonder at your surroundings.
</p><p>Faulkil leans against an ancient orase desk.
</p><p>Faulkil ponders.
</p><p>You smile at Faulkil.
</p><p>Faulkil smiles at you.
</p><p>You quietly say, "I hope to see you around town."
</p><p>Faulkil adopts an agreeable expression.
</p><p>Faulkil exclaims, speaking to you, "I expect you will!"
