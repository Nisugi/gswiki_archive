<p>[Clovertooth, Auditorium - 29536] (u4043075)
</p><p>Raw cedar timbers perfume the air, comprising the walls of the expansive hall.  Living evergreen boughs contrast frame the southern entrance, brightly illuminated by faceted glimaerstone orbs set high into the ceiling.  The light scatters over a few dozen rows of comfortably padded seats and rugs covering parts of the polished floor.  A central aisle delineated by a quartet of braziers leads toward an expansive cedar and pine stage framed by silver-trimmed blue curtains.  You also see the bloodstained Queatus disk with scuffed and dented sides, the diamond-crusted Jastalyn disk, the Randsford disk and the Yardie disk.
</p><p>Also here: Hadya, Commodore Jaysehn, Wolfloner who is sitting, Missoni who is sitting, Magnasco who is sitting, Bakarus, Roelon who is sitting, Preservationist Perigourd, Dildelgun who is sitting, Lady Aliashyrah, Lord Sorlu who is sitting, Queatus who is sitting, Chatelaine Traiva who is sitting, Trisscar, Lodestar Kobane who is sitting, Lord Randsford, Jastalyn who is sitting, Seneschal Dendum, Draelor, Blade Yardie, Mistress Lithyia, Lord Grutak, Lilanna who is sitting, Chronicler Falvicar who is sitting, Lady Opalina who is sitting

</p><p>Dildelgun pants.
</p><p>Dildelgun pants.
</p><p>Straightening your back, you give a formal, low curtsy to Dendum.  In time with your greater movement, you incline your head as well in a brief nod in his direction.
</p><p>You smile.
</p><p>Lithyia begins chuckling at Dildelgun!
</p><p><b>Dildelgun walks toward Lithyia.</b>
</p><p>You critically eye Dildelgun for a moment, rapidly reaching the conclusion that you are undoubtedly the more knowledgeable, educated party.
</p><p>Traiva accepts Jastalyn's sapphire cloakpin.
</p><p>Lithyia smiles at Dildelgun.

</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "Hi Dil."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia accepts Dildelgun's icy blue envelope.
</p><p>Lithyia says, "Thank you."
</p><p><b>Lithyia tears open her icy blue envelope and pulls a nondescript scarlet notecard from within.</b>
</p><p>Jastalyn giggles.
</p><p>Jastalyn nods.
</p><p>Traiva rests a gentle hand on Jastalyn's arm.
</p><p><b>Speaking playfully to Lithyia, you correct, "Diddle."</b>
</p><p>Dildelgun grins crookedly.
</p><p>Queatus nods to Perigourd in greeting.
</p><p>Dildelgun bows.
</p><p>Lithyia giggles at you.
</p><p>Dildelgun turns around.
</p><p>Dildelgun bows.
</p><p>Lithyia blushes a nice shade of dark red.
</p><p>Randsford bows to Traiva.
</p><p>Perigourd turns toward Queatus and renders a sharp hand salute.
</p><p>Jastalyn waves to Perigourd.
</p><p>Lithyia opens her folded notecard.
</p><p>Dildelgun sits down.
</p><p>Traiva flutters her wings at Randsford.
</p><p>Perigourd bows to Jastalyn.
</p><p>Traiva smiles at Randsford.
</p><p>Lithyia nods.

</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Trisscar.
</p><p>Speaking warmly to Randsford, Traiva says, "Good evening."
</p><p>Randsford smiles at Traiva.
</p><p><i><b>You see Mistress Lithyia Medeea the Gossip.</b></i>
</p><p><i><b>She appears to be a Human from Allace.</b></i>
</p><p><i><b>She is shorter than average.  She appears to be in the prime of life.  She has long-lashed chestnut brown eyes and olive skin.  She has long, meticulously kept deep brown hair parted to the side and pinned back with a blonde tortoiseshell haircomb inset with tiny matte teal turquoise.  She has an angular face and high cheekbones.  Her rounded nails are brushed with shiny coral pink lacquer with minute white opal dots.</b></i>
</p><p><i><b>She has a tiny pave diamond stud in her right nostril, a trio of small spiral seashells peeking out of the sand tattooed on her ankle, a tattooed symbol of Niima on her wrist, and a trio of walrus ivory rings adorned with intricate scrimshaw in the ridges of both her ears.</b></i>
</p><p><i><b>She is holding a silver-traced blue thanot talking stick in her right hand.</b></i>
</p><p><i><b>She is wearing an elaborate multi-tiered necklace of matte teal turquoise beads, a patinated silver locket, a cream tea-length gown draped in tiny turquoise glass bead tassels, a set of carved mother-of-pearl bangles, a petite silver signet ring, and a pair of cream lace-trimmed slippers.</b></i>
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "Welcome everyone to the debates!"
</pre>
<p>Trisscar quietly apologizes, "I might not be too talkative, sorry."
</p><p>Randsford nods to Traiva in greeting.
</p><p>Trisscar tilts her head toward Lithyia, examining her intently as the tip of one ear twitches briefly.
</p><p>Opalina tilts her head and tosses an inviting wink in Falvicar's direction.
</p><p>Sorlu grins at Lithyia.
</p><p>Dendum lets out a cheer!
</p><p>Sorlu applauds.
</p><p>Opalina heartily says, "Good evening Sorlu."
</p><p>Traiva smiles at Jastalyn.
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "I do not think I need to introduce myself as most of you know me but if you dont... you're probably lucky!"
</pre>
<p>With straightened posture and a firm chin, Sorlu presents himself to Opalina with a short, courteous bow.
</p><p>Falvicar gibbers incoherently.
</p><p>Lithyia giggles.
</p><p>Opalina turns to Lithyia and cheers!
</p><p>Sorlu begins chuckling at Lithyia!
</p><p>Randsford winks at Traiva.
</p><p>You laugh softly, trying to hide your amusement from Lithyia.
</p><p>Dildelgun cackles at Lithyia!
</p><p>Falvicar snickers at Opalina.
</p><p>Traiva begins chuckling at Randsford!
</p><p>Roelon casually observes his surroundings.
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "Everyone please have a seat!  I have just received the questions for this evening and am reviewing them!"
</pre>
<p>Randsford grins.
</p><p>Lithyia giggles at Queatus.
</p><p>Roelon pulls the folds of his black woolen kilt more tightly around his waist.
</p><p><b>Opalina heartily says, "Wait .."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "I would like to mention a few things before we begin..."
</pre>
<p>Lithyia raises an eyebrow in Opalina's direction.
</p><p><b>Lithyia asks, "Yes Opalina?"</b>
</p><p><b>Opalina heartily asks, "Where did the questions come from?"</b>
</p><p>Lithyia mutters dong.
</p><p>Falvicar whispers something to Opalina.
</p><p>Sorlu turns an inquisitive ear toward Lithyia.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "I will address all that in a moment."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia nods.
</p><p>You select an available padded seat and make your way over to it, quietly taking a spot.
</p><p><b>Lithyia exclaims, "Patience!"</b>
</p><p>Randsford glances at Roelon.
</p><p>Randsford nods to Roelon in greeting.
</p><p>Opalina hugs Roelon, who wraps her in a warm embrace.
</p><p>Roelon nods to Randsford in greeting.
</p><p>Opalina gazes in wonder at her surroundings.
</p><p>Roelon hugs Opalina, who wraps him in a warm embrace.
</p><p>Falvicar hugs Roelon.
</p><p>Bakarus just arrived.
</p><p>Bakarus glances around the room.
</p><p>Opalina curtsies to Bakarus.
</p><p>Roelon gives Falvicar a friendly hug.
</p><p>Bakarus nods respectfully.
</p><p>Roelon nods at Bakarus.
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "Everyone please have a seat!"
</pre>
<p>Randsford stares at Bakarus.
</p><p>Grutak and Perigourd bash their forearms in greeting.
</p><p>Opalina babbles something unintelligible.
</p><p>Falvicar sits down next to Opalina.
</p><p>Speaking to Sorlu, you whisper aloud, "I think she means it."
</p><p>Opalina selects an available padded seat and makes her way over to it, quietly taking a spot.
</p><p>Bakarus grins at Jastalyn.
</p><p>Perigourd turns toward Grutak and renders a sharp hand salute.
</p><p>Jastalyn chuckles.
</p><p>Sorlu pulls his Nalfein-styled cane up under his arm, clutching it like a riding crop.
</p><p>Sorlu selects an available padded seat and makes his way over to it, quietly taking a spot.
</p><p>You fold your hands in your lap.
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "I have just received the questions from Diddle.  I want to point out that I did not write these and am seeing them for the first time right now so please do not kill me if you do not like the questions I ask you!"
</pre>
<p>Lithyia giggles.
</p><p>Randsford shrugs at Roelon.
</p><p>Roelon chuckles.
</p><p>Dildelgun nods enthusiastically!
</p><p>You gaze in amusement at Lithyia.
</p><p><b>Lilanna asks, "What's a diddle?"</b>
</p><p><b>Lithyia points at Dildelgun.</b>
</p><p>You raise an eyebrow in Dildelgun's direction.
</p><p>Speaking to Grutak, Lilanna says, "Shut it..."
</p><p>Roelon surveys the area.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "That is a Diddle."</b>
</p><p>Roelon selects an available padded seat and makes his way over to it, quietly taking a spot.
</p><p><b>Grutak asks, "Where did Diddle get them from?"</b>
</p><p>Lithyia points at Dildelgun.
</p><p>Jastalyn ponders.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "You have to ask Diddle."</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking raspily to Lilanna, Dildelgun exclaims, "A me!"</b>
</p><p><i><b>You see Dildelgun.</b></i>
</p><p><i><b>He appears to be a Paradis Halfling.</b></i>
</p><p><i><b>He is tiny.  He appears to be very young.  He has beady dark eyes and sallow skin.  He has raggedly cut, greasy jet black hair.  He has a pinched face, a hooked nose and a pronounced overbite.</b></i>
</p><p><i><b>He is wearing a lace-accented silk hat adorned with a gold-tipped saffron plume, a crescent platinum torc ending in shadowglass-eyed rat heads, an ill-fitting saffron formal coat with split tails that drag along the ground, a pair of epaulettes set with thread-of-gold fringes, an enameled penguin chick brooch, a black leather satchel clasped with an onyx eye, a brushed onyx-on-ivory tartan tote, an iridescent lavender and ivory silk backpack, a grey silk pearl-buttoned shirt embellished with a jade-traced black rose design, an elegant golden belt, a golden silk sack, a leather-lined sturdy mahogany kit, and some jade ramie calf-length breeches embellished with a black rose petal design.</b></i>
</p><p>Opalina agrees with Grutak.
</p><p>Dildelgun raspily mutters, "But that ain't my name."
</p><p>Lilanna looks thoughtfully at Dildelgun.
</p><p>Lithyia grins at Jastalyn.
</p><p>Lilanna says, "Huh."
</p><p><b>Speaking to Dildelgun, Grutak asks, "Where did you get them from?"</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Yardie, Draelor says, "See? You just have to ask them not to kill you."</b>
</p><p>Dendum says, "Sounds correct."
</p><p>Speaking to Dildelgun, you say, "You should really just accept it."
</p><p>Falvicar whispers something to Opalina.
</p><p>Falvicar snickers to himself.
</p><p>Bakarus whispers something to Kobane.
</p><p><b>Speaking raspily to Grutak, Dildelgun says, "The people."</b>
</p><p>Dildelgun nods at Grutak.
</p><p><b>Opalina heartily says, "Wonderful."</b>
</p><p>Dildelgun grins at you.
</p><p>Bakarus nods at Perigourd.
</p><p>Falvicar grins impishly at Opalina.
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "I will be asking each of the candidates two questions tonight.  We'll do them in two rounds.  I have brought my talking stick with me as well.  Please do not answer until you have the stick in your hands!"
</pre>
<p>Speaking softly to Dildelgun, Traiva asks, "What is your proper name?"
</p><p>Speaking raspily to you, Dildelgun says, "If ya like it."
</p><p>Dildelgun winks at you.
</p><p>Randsford nods slowly at Bakarus.
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "I will not put a time limit on your answers however..."
</pre>
<p>Dendum lets out a cheer!
</p><p>Kobane whispers something to Bakarus.
</p><p>Lilanna groans at Lithyia.
</p><p>Perigourd nods at Bakarus.
</p><p>Speaking raspily to Traiva, Dildelgun says, "Dildelgun."
</p><p>Roelon glances at Lithyia.
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "I ask that you not ramble on and on and on and on and on"
</pre>
<p>Roelon grins.
</p><p>Dendum lets out a cheer!
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "If you do, I will take the stick back and beat you with it"
</pre>
<p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "Like a pinata"
</pre>
<p>Lithyia nods.
</p><p>Speaking softly to Dildelgun, Traiva repeats, "Dildelgun."
</p><p>Lithyia taps a silver-traced blue thanot talking stick, which is in her right hand.
</p><p>Lilanna starts chortling.
</p><p>Opalina mutters fair.
</p><p>Traiva smiles at Dildelgun.
</p><p>Sorlu chuckles to himself.
</p><p>Dendum waves his hands back and forth, one over the other, in a definitive negative motion.
</p><p>You smile at Sorlu.
</p><p>Sorlu nods at Lithyia.
</p><p><b>Lilanna asks, "Will there be candy?"</b>
</p><p>Jastalyn begins chuckling at Lithyia!
</p><p><b>Opalina heartily says, "I have candy."</b>
</p><p>Jastalyn just nudged Lilanna.
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "Please be courteous of your fellow candidates and most of the people here...."
</pre>
<p>Lithyia giggles.
</p><p>Opalina grabs a carved bright red strawberry from inside her elesine sack.
</p><p>Lilanna grins at Jastalyn.
</p><p>Falvicar gently bites Opalina.
</p><p>With a brief but appraising look, Opalina inspects a collection of tiny round candies before selecting a single one from a carved bright red strawberry.
</p><p>First taking a quick breath, Opalina pops a tiny round candy into her mouth and chews.
</p><p>Sorlu appears to be trying hard not to grin.
</p><p>Opalina absent-mindedly drops a carved bright red strawberry into her elesine sack.
</p><p><b>Lilanna says, "Pinata gotta have candy."</b>
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "I shall begin in a moment if you are all ready?"
</pre>
<p>Lilanna nods.
</p><p>You nod at Lithyia.
</p><p>Lithyia nods.
</p><p>Clapping his hands together in excitement, Dendum nods eagerly.
</p><p>Draelor nods.
</p><p><b>Lithyia says, "Bare with me a moment then..."</b>
</p><p><b>Speaking to Lithyia, Sorlu says, "I am quite ready."</b>
</p><p>Sorlu smiles at Lithyia.
</p><p>Jastalyn smiles at Lithyia.
</p><p>Bakarus nods respectfully.
</p><p><b>Opalina heartily exclaims, "I need a minute!"</b>
</p><p>Kobane grins at Roelon.
</p><p>Lilanna squints at Bakarus.

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Round_1_of_Questions">Round 1 of Questions</span></h2>
<p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "My first question is going to go to Jastalyn!"
</pre>
<p><i><b>You see Jastalyn Dragorth the Protector of the Universal Pack.</b></i>
</p><p><i><b>She appears to be a Half-Elf from Ta'Faendryl.</b></i>
</p><p><i><b>She is diminutive and has a voluptuous body.  She appears to be in the prime of life.  She has thick-lashed cobalt-violet eyes and petal-soft, tanned skin.

</p>
<pre>   "Having served two terms previously on the Town Council, which moments or achievements during those terms would you point towards as evidence of your ability to lead?"
</pre>
<p>Lithyia offers Jastalyn a silver-traced blue thanot talking stick.

</p><p>Lithyia winks at Lilanna.
</p><p>Lilanna hums a jaunty melody, masterfully exploring the cheerful notes.
</p><p>Bakarus chuckles.
</p><p>Jastalyn recites softly:
</p>
<pre>   "Being part of a council doesn't exactly test my ability to lead.  It's more of a lesson in teamwork.  My ability to lead is evident in the House and Hall that I have run successfully for years"

</p><p>Jastalyn recites softly:
</p>

</p><p>Dendum snaps his fingers.
</p><p>Lithyia recites:
</p>
<pre>   "Over the years, there's been a vast amount of corruption unearthed within Clovertooth Hall. This has been discovered on the administrative level, the Town Council level, and even the Mayoral level.  You, yourself, were accused of betraying Icemule to our enemy during a time of war, which was confirmed by Mayor Dabbings, though he later pardoned you for this crime for reasons unknown.  If you are elected, will you be able to restrain yourself from betraying Icemule again?"

</p><p>You accept Trisscar's offer and are now holding a silver-traced blue thanot talking stick.

Keeping that same warmth in mind, I will work very hard to bring back the same feeling to anyone who should choose to make Icemule their forever home."

</p><p><b>Grutak says, "What does it mean to be safe and secure.  Those are very important and profound words."</b>

He brings his closed right fist respectfully against the front of his shirt with a faint creak, the motion drawing attention to his feather-patterned leather sleeves.  Misty green light seeps into his body from the shirt, a brief ethereal image of a wolf overlaying his face in a temporary mask as he straightens up.
</p><p>Falvicar shrugs.
</p><p>Dildelgun gives his monir stick horse a firm slap on its imaginary rump and lurches forward, holding the reins of the bucking pony securely in your fist.
