<pre style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 2em; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 7px 10px; background: #f3f3f9; border: line; text-align: left; font-size:95%; font-family: Consolas, DejaVu sans mono, Courier New, monospace; color: black; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap;">[Valyrka's Tree, Study]
Set apart from the rest of the tree, the circular room is supported by a buttressed platform. Long fronds from a multitude of tropical plants are layered over a wooden frame creating a shady canopy above. Small glaes lanterns hang from the rim holding bright candles that illuminate the floor below. A sturdy railing encloses the area, rich green vines twining about each spindle. Carved from tanik, a large desk with matching chair looms against an outer barrier with several cushioned benches scattered nearby. You also see a large crystal cart with some stuff on it, a glowing deep green portal, an elven body, an elven body, a bloody severed head and a scrawny elven body laying in a pool of blood.

Valyrka says, "Feel free to grab a seat and a drink."
Vyctus says, "Also Hello."
Lynesi says, "Hello all."
Vyctus asks, "Do we sit on the bodies?"
Valyrka asks, "If you really want to?"
Arenglae says, "Squishy."
Valyrka frets.
Daevian asks, "We were supposed to show up drunk, right?"
Daevian gazes at Valyrka.
Daevian nods.
Summer softly says, "That's what I heard, anywa."
Summer softly says, "Anyway."
Speaking to Summer, Daevian says, "Obviously."
Valyrka says, "Sure."
Valyrka nods.

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"When a GM is asked to take on a city, there is always concern for playing NPC's that you did not create. That was my biggest worry. I tried to start small and now I am feeling more comfortable."</b>

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
      <b>"I have spent the past months cleaning up a large to do list and I feel like I am ready to start really helping the city thrive."</b>

Daevian lets out a cheer!
Krystalena lets out a cheer!

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"We just had a very successful festival this month. Thank you to everyone who attended. It was appreciated. I took notes on the arena and my email is open for more suggestions. I have a list of shops and new items to do for next time, and there will be one. I plan to run this every other year. Things can change, but that is the plan as of right now."</b>

Illumiada says, "The festival had great clothes."
Quando agrees with Illumiada.
Uniana says, "Festival was lit."
Valyrka grins.
<b>Valyrka says, "I loved watching you all."</b>
Lynaera breaks out in a triumphant grin.
<b>Valyrka says, "Thank you for being the heartblood of Ta'Vaalor."</b>
Arlerathen says, "I had fun in the box tbh."
Valyrka grins.
Vyctus says, "It was a great festival."
Agathilea says, "It was a wonderful festival."
Yardie says, "It was fun to be an outsider in Ta'Vaalor, and people here were rather welcoming."
Valyrka nods at Yardie.
Krystalena says, "We try."
Speaking to Yardie, Agathilea says, "You are ours."
Valyrka says, "That is the response far and wide."
Teveriel says, "FoF was pretty fun. Even if I got the beatdown."
Valyrka grins at Teveriel.
Speaking to Teveriel, Daevian says, "It was fun to watch."
Speaking to Yardie, you say, "Yeah sorry that's how it works. You show up you are RP with us we keep you."
Ithilwyn grins at you.
Rmalie agrees with you.
Teveriel snickers.

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	"<b>Things we have done...."</b>

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"I removed the paper system. Some folks were ok with that some were not, but I think in the end they are not really missed? "</b>
	
Talimiir asks, "We had a paper system?"
Talimiir appears to be trying hard not to grin.
Quando says, "Yeah, screw papers."

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"They were put in place after a storyline where an Aelotoi was the villain as I recall and the former king was paranoid of all outsiders and tightened up security. It was time for them to go IMHO. "</b>

Daevian says, "I liked them."
Orssus asks, "People were against the removal of the paper system?"
Dharana says, "City docs."
Rinori says, "Well."
Teveriel sternly says, "Papers, please."
Agathilea says, "Not that I am aware."
Speaking to Orssus, Daevian says, "I was."
Valyrka says, "Some where."
Dharana says, "Nice to have those gone."
Arenglae nods at Valyrka.
Valyrka says, "Were."
Speaking to Valyrka, Talimiir says, "It ran its course."
Rinori says, "Not like we'd ever try to kill the king again."
You say, "I'll just be happy to never have to argue over papers ever again."
Rmalie softly says, "It was unnecessary."
Krystalena says, "It'll be unusual to not hear "can we get rid of the papers?" as the first question in the ooc meeting."
Speaking to Rmalie, Talimiir corrects, "At the time it made sense, but... times pass... things change... they were due for removal."
<b>Valyrka says, "Anyway, I can take the fall if you are unhappy or the praise if you are."</b>
Daevian says, "But I'm not gonna cry that it's gone."
You point at Krystalena.
Speaking to Krystalena, Orssus says, "I could still ask, for posterity."
<b>Valyrka says, "Do not really need praise."</b>
Speaking dryly to Orssus, you say, "That's okay."
Quando says, "If I have it my way."
<b>Valyrka says, "But there you have it."</b>
Speaking to Valyrka, Anarquendi says, "You made my partial citizenship pin less special. That hurt me."
Valyrka says, "Sorry."
Daevian laughs at Anarquendi!
Valyrka asks, "I can stab you in the heart with it and make it hurt more?"
Quando says, "No one ever sees it anyways, you're always sneakin' around."
Speaking to Valyrka, Anarquendi says, "Acceptable."
Anarquendi grins.
Teveriel says, "This man gets it."

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"The system was very ingrained in the town. If you find messaging or something that refers to papers, please feel free to let me know. I want to make sure things are consistent."</b>

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"Over the past year, I have been working to clean up messaging around the city. Please feel free to email me any issues with any messaging so it can be reviewed."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "Gs4-Valyrka@play.net."</b>

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"The citizenship NPC is now kinder when turning folks away."</b>

Orssus says, "Doesn't bite your head off for asking."
<b>Valyrka says, "Citizenship is not going to change."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "I might as well just say it up front."</b>
Krystalena says, "That'll become the new first ooc question."

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	"There has been talk about opening up Helgreth's."<b></b>
	
Lynaera chants, "Elven osa, elven osa.."
Krystalena says, "I'd rather see the Golden Hawk opened."
Daevian says, "I would prefer a separate bar be opened and one remain exclusive."
Ithilwyn agrees with Krystalena.
Teveriel says, "Golden Hawk here, me too."
Valyrka says, "The golden hawk is not opening at this time, but will be utilized more."
Krystalena says, "Good. It's sad to see it there and not being used."
Anarquendi asks, "The Golden Hawk is the tavern for Legion officers, correct?"
Krystalena says, "How many bars does a town actually need."
Valyrka says, "A lot."
Daevian says, "A lot."
Speaking to Krystalena, Talimiir asks, "How many can fit?"
Speaking to Krystalena, Yardie answers, "Yes."
Speaking to Krystalena, Teveriel says, "All of them."
Valyrka says, "So Helgreth is up in the air, but something I did look into."
Krystalena says, "We have 2 that everyone can get into, 1 that's elven exclusive, one that's reservist exclusive and one nobody can get into."
Valyrka says, "Plus the dancing dachre bar."
Krystalena says, "True."
Daevian says, "Which is open to everyone."
Orssus says, "A lot of people over look that little bar in there."
Valyrka says, "And Ravelin."
Daevian says, "Plenty of spots for non-elves, in my opinion."
Vyctus says, "I really just tend to go to Malwith's."
<b></b>
Valyrka recites:<b></b>
	<b>"I have been looking into the skill checks on Aradhul road. I do not have anything I can report at this time, but I am requesting a review of them. No guarantees, but it is on my list and is being researched."</b>

Arianiss says, "That's probably a good idea to facilitate getting to OTF from here "on a whim"."
<b>Valyrka says, "It has been requested, so it cannot hurt to research and such."</b>
Anarquendi says, "Anecdotally, I know Physical Fitness is a big factor."
Anarquendi says, "Going from 1x PF to 2x PF made a huge difference with the jump./."
Valyrka says, "You can also ring over it."
Quando says, "The jump up on the rock sucks."
Orssus says, "Ah, that makes sense, I was curious what jumping the rock and bridge counted as skill wise."
You say, "The rock climb always seemed high, especially for what level the first ring of red forest is."
Rmalie softly says, "I remember the rock being a task."
<b>Valyrka says, "Anyway I do not make the decisions there but I am requesting a review."</b>
Quando says, "I've reviewed it, it sucks."
Speaking to Quando, Valyrka says, "Thank you for your report."
Valyrka grins.
Quando says, "Anytime."
Krystalena says, "It is weird to use spirit guide out there and end up at the bottom of the ravine instead of the town for which side of the river you're on."
Talimiir agrees with Krystalena.
Speaking to Krystalena, Anarquendi says, "On the Illistim side, once you climb that wall, you'll fog to the bottom of the ravine. On the Vaalor side, once you climb over the oak I believe you land at the bottom of the ravine."

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"There are gaps in hunting, I know it, you know it, we all know it. I am looking into adding hunting. It will not happen immediately but I am in the beginning stages of a proposal. If and when I have something to report, I will. "</b>

Daevian nods approvingly.
You turn to Valyrka and cheer!
Yardie says, "Oh nice."
Talimiir exclaims, "Some progress is progress!"
Anarquendi says, "That's huge."
Ithilwyn beams!
Speaking to Aureliano, Daevian says, "Well, that's one item off our list."
Krystalena turns to Valyrka and cheers!
<b>Valyrka says, "I have been asking questions and looking at gaps."</b>
Orssus asks, "Which gap would be the first to address?"
Orssus asks, "Between the isle and the bog?"
You say, "Having slogged through the gap like a stubborn bird on grim camps - thank you."
Valyrka says, "But elves are superior and can handle the difficulties."
Talimiir says, "Let's hope."
Speaking to Yardie, Arianiss asks, "Do you feel this is an Invoker issue?"
Agathilea says, "Yes we can."
<b>Valyrka says, "Might as well do this now."</b>
Valyrka says, "I will bring up a pink elephant in the Nations."
Daevian asks, "The invoker?"
Daevian grins.
Talimiir asks, "We have elephants?"
<b>Valyrka says, "The Invoker."</b>
Teveriel says, "One o' them invokers."
Teveriel says, "Yeah boi."
Teveriel says, "That's the stuff."

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"I did ask, but there are no plans to add an invoker in the East."</b>

Arianiss frowns.
Daevian mutters under his breath.
Talimiir flails his arms about.
Dharana sighs.
Uniana says, "Seems totally fair."
Orssus says, "You don't need to have them dispelled."
Uniana rolls her eyes.
Daevian asks, "Is there a reasoning for that?"
Speaking in Elven, Amalexia says, "Well, knives out then."
Agathilea asks, "What?"
Speaking to Valyrka, Talimiir asks, "Can you put Torbot on the royal payroll?"
Speaking to Valyrka, Amalexia asks, "Who do we shank until they see the light?"
Agathilea asks, "But we need one?"
<b>Valyrka says, "It is not a decision I can make."</b>
Elaejia says, "Le boo."
Speaking to Valyrka, you ask, "Can you please report to high ups that I find that utterly ludicrous?"
Arlerathen says, "What if we added a portal directly to the Invoker somewhere in Ta'Vaalor."
Agathilea says, "Yes, we need one."
<b>Valyrka says, "I am just the messenger on this one."</b>
Teveriel says, "Yeah, I feel like it drives a lot of people west when they'd otherwise love to be here."
Arianiss says, "I just really don't understand the benefit the Invoker currently gives now.. I understand it being around for testing during Duskruin and what not.. but to keep it around, and Wehn only.. that really, really hurts things."
Speaking to Valyrka, Anarquendi asks, "Out of curiosity, what is the reasoning? Dreaven doesn't operate in the EN, so there's no need?"
Agathilea says, "Torbot is not here all the time."
Speaking to Valyrka, Talimiir asks, "Did 'the powers that be' at least say why?"
Lynaera thoughtfully says, "Just remove the invoker in the west, so all is even."
Arianiss says, "I literally do not come here because it's a hassle."
Ithilwyn softly says, "Like, retire permanently sad."
Agathilea says, "And it is not fair."
Daevian says, "I would be very curious about what the reasoning is on the invoker."
Krystalena asks, "Wasn't the invoker put in because of the problems the Dreavenings were causing?"
Agathilea says, "At least give us a portal to the invoker."
Aureliano says, "Guys, let's let her finish her agenda list before we start diving on other stuff."
Lynaera nods once at Aureliano.
Quando says, "Oooo, a portal to the invoker would be nice."
<b>Valyrka exclaims, "'almost done!"</b>
You say, "If you're going to give one half of the world an incredibly unbalancing tool and deny it to the other half then you may as well close the road and kick us out."
Arianiss nods to you.
Illumiada nods to you.

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"While the legion is an important part of the city, all races and genders are welcome at all events. I think the leadership in the Legion has proven that over the past year. "</b>

Illumiada agrees with you.
Daevian agrees with you.
Krystalena agrees with Valyrka.
Yardie grins at Valyrka.
<b>Valyrka says, "Please, always want to be involved."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "On a personal note."</b>
Yardie says, "I've been treated better here, than on the other side."
<b>Valyrka says, "Things I have on my list to do this year from a personal stand point. I did sit down and look at my personal strengths and weaknesses and where I could do better as a GM."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "I need to be about as npcs more. Participate in the daily life of the city and do my part to bring it to life. Look for more regular merchants. Citizen and non-citizen. I am looking at a TV storyline for the coming year, but that is not set in stone, but I have something in mind, and again all are welcome."</b>
Krystalena exclaims, "Yay story!"
<b>Speaking to Valyrka, Quando asks, "So, ya gonna strut around wearing the Guard Captain's face?"</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "Somtimes."</b>
Speaking to Valyrka, Arianiss asks, "Is there anything we can do to push for getting you some help?"
Speaking appreciatively to Valyrka, Rmalie says, "You are appreciated."
<b>Valyrka says, "This girl wears many faces."</b>
Quando says, "He's intimidating enough without being possessed."
Daevian says, "I would love to see more NPC interaction."
<b>Valyrka says, "I do have one or two personal items."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "Since I do not know all of you."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "My best time to play is 7 pm - 11 Pm."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "Eastern."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "I am a school teacher."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "I do not get home until 5 or 6 some nights."</b>
Yardie exclaims, "Teachers unite!"
Krystalena says, "It's tough being a teacher."
Yardie exclaims, "Middle school!"
<b>Valyrka says, "I also have dyslexia."</b>
Krystalena says, "I bet that makes programming a real challenge."
<b>Valyrka says, "So I apologize for any typos that come up."</b>
Talimiir waves his hand in a dismissive gesture.
Ithilwyn softly says, "Just makes you one of us....we all do it from time to time."
Agathilea says, "Typos are a part of life."
Speaking to Valyrka, Talimiir says, "That LAST thing you need to do is apologize to us for something tiny like that..."
Ithilwyn agrees with Talimiir.
<b>Valyrka says, "It is a sore point with me sometimes, as I hate to mess up. But it happens."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "If I am slow to respond I am probably rereading what I typed."</b>
Lynaera says, "Typos don't exist in character. If the character knows what was typed/intended, there is no typo you can "hear"."
<b>Valyrka says, "So, if you can go with the flow with me I appreciate it, and I have been and will continue to do my best to take care."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "And my last thing."</b>

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"I am someone who almost never hints at things I do not know will happen for certain. Sometimes things take longer than thought, sometimes things do not get approved. It does seem like things move slowly at times, but I do not like to talk about things until I know they will happen."</b>

Orssus says, "So no speculation from the GM."
Rmalie agrees with Orssus.
Krystalena says, "Likely a good thing. Then we aren't disappointed when the higher ups say no."
<b>Valyrka says, "So if I say I have no information or I say no or yes, I truly mean it."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "I am pushing to make the EN where it should be."</b>
<b>Valyrka says, "We need some updates."</b>
Valyrka just opened the coloring book for 34 signups.
<b>Valyrka says, "If you have question feel free to sign up."</b>

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"Oops and the very last thing from me"</b>

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"There will be something after EG that will involve TI and TV, and anyone else who comes."</b>

Krystalena says, "Ooooo."
Agathilea exclaims, "Oh, in that case I saw nothing!"

<b>Valyrka recites:</b>
	<b>"I just did not want to start it before EG and have to stop."</b> </pre>

<b>Uniana says, "You mentioned that you are getting the EN to where it needs to be, can you explain how you see that? What is *that* vision? Also please make sure to bring around more aqilorn and lasimor because we have no other way to get it. &lt;3."</b>
Valyrka says, "The hunting gaps is a big one."
Uniana mutters something about priorities.
Rmalie softly says, "Agreed. I love hunting here, but the gaps make it difficult."
Speaking to Valyrka, Talimiir says, "With the right gaps filled, a character can potentially stay here from 0-to-cap nearly."
Valyrka says, "While I have no control over the invoker, I have asked for OSA."
Daevian nods approvingly at Valyrka.
Vyctus exclaims, "I would love to get OSA here!"
Valyrka says, "When or if I have more information I will pass it on."
Lynaera says, "EN OSA fills all level gaps."
Daevian says, "Retser spoke of it in Discord a few weeks back."
Daevian says, "It osunds promising."
Speaking to Valyrka, you say, "Please with the pushing for OSA. All my friends left and are pirates now and I'm sad and I hate boats."
Orssus says, "It would have to be toy boats on the lake of fear."
Valyrka says, "I hope that helps with your question. I would like to see us have these opportunities."
Talimiir says, "T'V may not be Port of Long Beach-sized, but it's port-ish enough... to where it could be supported."
Krystalena says, "EN deserves shiny new things occasionally, too."
Valyrka agrees with Krystalena.


Speaking to Valyrka, Daevian says, "That brings me to my comment and question."
Valyrka turns to face Daevian.
<b>Speaking to Valyrka, Daevian says, "So, as a player who plays as a retired military member rather than active, I find TV lacking in that regard."</b>
Valyrka asks, "As in a place for the retired?"
Daevian says, "I'm trying not to wall of text you."
Daevian says, "Still working on it."
Daevian grins.
Valyrka says, "Ah."
Valyrka grins.
<b>Daevian says, "I know that several of us are interested in perhaps more political intrigue than everything being so military focused. There's still the 5 noble houses that are as of yet unnamed..."</b>
Valyrka says, "I think he is asking to be put out to pasture."
<b>Daevian says, "And a Council of Regents who we never really interact with."</b>
Valyrka says, "Fleshing out some of the documentation."
<b>Daevian asks, "What are the chances we can have some storyline involved in that in the future, including perhaps opening up some spots for players to get onto the council?"</b>
Speaking to Daevian, Valyrka says, "Interesting... and something I can add to my list."
Speaking to Valyrka, Daevian says, "I am speaking for several people here who would love some political intrigue, internally or externally."
Valyrka nods.
<b>Speaking to Valyrka, Daevian says, "And one last recommendation, quite quickly."</b>
Valyrka says, "Please."
<b>Daevian says, "Then I'll step down from my soapbox."</b>
<b>Daevian says, "Ta'Vaalor is so often boasted as all military, and I would like to see more focus outside of that, even outside of storylines. I know when I submitted to you my artifacts for the museum, I tried to focus on something other than just "We hit things with swords and slaughter undead without mercy."."</b>
Valyrka nods at Daevian.
<b>Daevian says, "I'd love to see some other venues. A museum focused on engineering and architecture, maybe."</b>
Daevian says, "A real library."
Valyrka says, "I swing sword and kill stuff."
Talimiir says, "Maul here... but... still...."
Daevian says, "A little more nerdery that is around military in a way that makes sense."
Yardie says, "Regarding the political intrigue, from what I see on the other side, there's always the thought of Ta'Vaalor as a threat for some reason. And with some of the antics in the world, I'm always curious to see how people do regard the political arena."
Daevian says, "I would imagine TV has great engineers, strategists, physicists..."
Daevian says, "I'd just like to see more of that worked in."
Daevian says, "That is all."
Speaking to Daevian, Valyrka says, "So noted."
Daevian says, "Thank you."
Valyrka says, "I do not know why everyone s afraid of us."
Quando says, "We should plan an invasion of Zul."
Corlyne says, "Take over Zul, you just have to get through Clunk."
Krystalena says, "We're the boogy man."
Vyctus says, "Invade Ta'Illistim, they'll never see it coming."


Valyrka turns to face you.
Valyrka nods to you.
You exclaim, "Oh!"
You nod once.
<b>You say, "I have two things but they're both brief so I hope you'll all forgive me."</b>
<b>Speaking to Valyrka, you say, "I just wanted to ask if you saw my post about the bathhouse in the empath guild because it has *literally* been driving me crazy for two years."</b>
You smirk.
Valyrka says, "I saw something."
Speaking to you, Lynaera says, "Stole my question."
Valyrka asks, "Is there supposed to be one?"
Valyrka says, "I can search for it."
Krystalena says, "Yeah, we have a bath that's "closed for repairs" or something like that."
Valyrka says, "Oh."
Valyrka asks, "Dear goddess we have had stinky folks that long?"
Speaking to Valyrka, you say, "I'm not sure, but there really appears to be one. Like, mosaics that mention a bath. And there are three weirdly locked arches. In the empath cloister."
Krystalena says, "It's in the empath guild."
You exclaim, "We're a town of smelly elves!"
Valyrka asks, "O only empaths would smell nice?"
Valyrka says, "Ok I will see if there is a bath there."
You nod once.
<b>You say, "Okay, second quick more serious thing."</b>
You cough.
<b>Speaking to Valyrka, you exclaim, "This is an unsual subject to bring up, but I just want you to know V that we all see you over here with (now) two cities and what? Like,four races? We love you for being so passionate about your elves but I guess ... ma'am, who do we have to talk to get you some helpers? Do you have helpers? We don't want you to burn out. There are only so many hours in the day!"</b>
Rmalie agrees with you.
Ithilwyn agrees with you.
Dharana nods.
Valyrka says, "I am not sure what the plan is."
Arlerathen asks, "Does anyone even want to help?"
You hear someone cough.
Amalexia says, "You too, Elysani, don't get burnt out either."
Valyrka says, "There are some of us who work together."
The voice of Elysani asks, "You know what next month is, right?"
Amalexia says, "Yes."
Vyctus asks, "Christmas?"
Valyrka says, "So I have some folks to pull from."
Daevian says, "No."
Arenglae says, "Definitely not EG or anything."
Daevian asks, "What is it?"
Amalexia says, "I'll send booze."
Teveriel asks, "Is it your birthday?"
Teveriel says, "Happy birthday."
Vyctus says, "EG is basically Gemstone Christmas."
Valyrka nods.
Quando asks, "Thrakmas?"
The voice of Elysani says, "SORRY I DERAILED THE QUESTIONS."
You exclaim, "That's okay that was my question!"
Valyrka says, "Any gm can run things in all towns to be honest."
Valyrka says, "Even if we have towns we over see, but I do have a few angles of my own."
You say, "I will run through discord with a big "Come to TV we love RP!" banner if I have to."
Valyrka grins.
Krystalena says, "There's likely GMs out there who would love to help you kill us."
Krystalena says, "It's Ta'Vaalor after all."
You point at Krystalena.
Speaking to you, Yardie says, "I felt this side of the world got the rough patch when the RP contest took place in May."
Valyrka says, "As you saw we had so many gms here for the fest."
Valyrka says, "And I have some pulled in for more than that."
Yardie says, "I was here during that month, great RPers, but got very little love."
Speaking to Yardie, you say, "I missed that, sadly."
Valyrka says, "So while I am not sure what the plans are, I have been pulling in some folks to help with NPCing and such."
Valyrka says, "I hope I answered your questions."
Valyrka nods to you.


Valyrka turns to face Anarquendi.
Valyrka says, "I am coming back to you."
Anarquendi says, "Ok... sorry about ducking out. I actually have two questions / points."<b></b>
Anarquendi asks, "First, is there any plan to revisit the level caps at each of the gates during TV invasions?"<b></b>
Valyrka says, "Yes."
Valyrka nods at Anarquendi.
Valyrka says, "I will announce them after I update my wiki and such."
<b>Anarquendi says, "I only say that because I understand why they have been designated the way they are, but it makes lighting the beacon / coming into town if you can't use Aradhul Road very dangerous."</b>
Anarquendi says, "It also renders the Wyvern obsolete."
Valyrka nods at Anarquendi.
Speaking to Anarquendi, Krystalena asks, "The drake?"
Orssus asks, "Swap Amaranth bridge levels with Annatto Bridge levels?"
<b>Anarquendi asks, "Second: this is not meant to be an attack, but more of a criticism. Is there an plans on going over the Tournament rules before the next Festival of the Fallen?"</b>
Speaking to Krystalena, Talimiir says, "The fire smokey spitting thing."
Valyrka says, "Yes."
<b>Anarquendi asks, "Specifically, looking at the spells that are allowed / banned?"</b>
Valyrka says, "There is."
<b>Anarquendi says, "And not having to park a GM in the medic tent to break everyone out of roots."</b>
Valyrka says, "It is on the festival list of things to do."
Anarquendi asks, "Will there be a chance for player input?"
Valyrka says, "You can email me any input."
Anarquendi nods at Valyrka.
Anarquendi says, "That's all I have."
Valyrka says, "And I can discuss it with the coder."
Valyrka nods.

Valyrka turns to face Illumiada.
Valyrka exclaims, "You are up!"
Speaking to Valyrka, Illumiada exclaims, "Thanks for meeting with us tonight!"
Valyrka beams!
Valyrka says, "Thank you all for coming."
<b>Illumiada says, "I wanted to ask about the glass amulets. They're not doing anything, and I've been told they're supposed to cast invisibility."</b>
Valyrka says, "I got a bug for them."
Illumiada beams happily at Valyrka!
Valyrka says, "So I need to rebuild them."
Speaking to Valyrka, Illumiada says, "That's all I wondered."
Valyrka says, "I hope to do that this week and will announce when done."


Valyrka turns to face Aureliano.
Valyrka says, "And you."
Valyrka nods at Aureliano.
Aureliano says, "I have a little bit of a bundled question:"
Quando says, "Take a seat..."
Quando sits down.
Valyrka leans back.
Valyrka takes a drink from her strong spirits.
Valyrka looks rather relaxed.
You chuckle.
Talimiir says, "That's Aureliano speak for "I have sixteen questions I'm going to reword into appearing as if it's just three..."
Valyrka smirks.
<b>Aureliano says, "I'd love to see more done with Icemule and the treaty. Its a hot button issue for a lot of players, and some directions on it would be fun! Tied into that, any discussion on a possible airship connection to Icemule/Hinterwilds or whatever? That may be totally outside of your control."</b>
Valyrka says, "Glad I poured my drink."
Krystalena says, "Ooo yeah, and our little village over there."
Speaking to Aureliano, Pilatherel says, "Glad you brought that up."
Valyrka says, "The whole elven village icemule thing is in the back of my mind but down on the list."
<b>Aureliano asks, "Finally, if storyline/NPC stuff starts up, I've really liked how other cities have a night/time set aside. Could that be doable here?"</b>
Speaking to Aureliano, Valyrka says, "And yes I am looking for a night for Ti and TV."
Rmalie softly says, "That was my question."
Valyrka says, "Where you know I will be here doing something."
Speaking to Aureliano, Orssus asks, "A night/time set aside?"
Rmalie nods at Orssus.
Orssus says, "Oh."
Krystalena says, "We could have Murder Mondays. The students were all crabby today so you can come kill us on Mondays."
Orssus says, "Like wyvern wednesdays."
Krystalena grins.
Speaking to Orssus, Aureliano says, "Mule has Midweek Mule Train on Wednesdays, QST had dedicated days, etc."
Lynaera says, "Having a set night for RP and things, like we did with FWI (or even WL) was very useful."
Valyrka says, "In short, yes I was looking at it."
Valyrka says, "I will look at the day I can be around most consistently."
Valyrka says, "Ok that was only two items."
Valyrka asks, "I heard sixteen?"
Krystalena giggles.
Aureliano asks, "And airship to Hinterwilds possibility?"
Aureliano grins.
Speaking to Valyrka, Talimiir says, "I'm confident that whatever day YOU choose will be fine with US; I think the goal is having a consistent day, regardless of which day that happens to be...."
Valyrka says, "If i have an info on that I will let you know."
Aureliano jokingly asks, "It was a 3 bundle. Hinterwilds is kinda related to Icemule?"
Aureliano exclaims, "Sounds good. Thanks!"


Valyrka turns to face Avalenya.
Valyrka exclaims, "You are up!"
<b>Avalenya asks, "So my question is storyline related, I understand if you can't speak to it directly.....after the events of the Ravager/Manticore and Ta'Vaalor took there was a small invasion of orcs in the fortress....which I guess we assumed to be related to the prisoners the fortress had taken in?"</b>
Valyrka says, "To be honest it was me getting the feel for how invasions went over here."
Dharana asks, "The half-Krol prisoners?"
Avalenya asks, "Is there any plan to continue that storyline? or is that part of the larger Dark Alliance....thing that's happening?"
Agathilea says, "Oooh."
The voice of Elysani says, "#freeKyjani."
Quando says, "Orcs will be orcs."
Valyrka says, "There is not, but it would make an interesting twist."
Teveriel says, "Orcs will be orcs."
Agathilea exclaims, "Kyjani needs to be brought to justice....I mean sure!"
Teveriel says, "And sheep will be scared."
Orssus says, "I took that orc invasion as just a minor grimswarm related thing."
Yardie says, "Kyjani was interesting, to be honest. Gave the krolvin a voice and an identity."
Valyrka says, "It was me learning my way around."
Avalenya nods understandingly at Valyrka.
Yardie says, "Still, Kyjani was a slaver, and slavers need to get got."
Krystalena says, "We liked the practice. Was good to shake the dust off."
Yardie says, "Slavery must die a horrid death."
Valyrka says, "She is in the darkest room in the darkest dungeon."
Valyrka says, "With no fashion."
Orssus gasps.
Orssus says, "She's naked."
Arianiss says, "I never did get a response to my letter on Kyjani."
Arianiss exclaims, "She's probably dead!"
Ithilwyn softly says, "Booo, that gives knitting a bad name...."
Yardie asks, "Who's crying?"
Avalenya says, "Ok, that was more or less my question, thank you."
Avalenya smiles.


Valyrka turns to face Arlerathen.
Valyrka exclaims, "You are up!"
<b>Speaking to Valyrka, Arlerathen says, "Avawren already asked my question, about helpers and a "full" staff actually making things happen, so I guess I'll just say that I'm new and looking forward to all of the junk you have said is in the works. It will be good to see some Town Crier announcements in regards to TV for once."</b>
Valyrka says, "It will."
Valyrka agrees with Arlerathen.
You nod in agreement.
Lynaera murmurs, "Yes, the Ta'Vaalor correspondent needs to shape up!"
Lynaera blushes a dark rose hue to the tips of her ears.
Valyrka says, "But yes I have some angels or demons whatever you want to call them."
You poke Lynaera in the ribs.
Arenglae pinches Lynaera!

Valyrka turns to face Vyctus.
<b>Vyctus says, "Hi! So my question was about OSA and you answered that. So, I think Uniana had a statement that I want to not be blamed for letting her make."</b>
Vyctus nods at Uniana.
Valyrka says, "I can expand on it."
Valyrka says, "There will be OSA in the east."
Valyrka says, "Just confirmed."
Arlerathen says, "Nice."
Vyctus lets out a cheer!
Valyrka says, "I cannot give you a timeline."
Vyctus says, "That's fantastic."
Valyrka says, "But it is in the works."
Uniana recites:
 "Listen if you don't know me, I don't care. You can absolutely ask Uniana for elemental spells and 90% if I'm not in the middle of some crazy ass RP, I will help you out. I might ask you to step away from a populated area but anyone here should absolutely feel like you can politely bug me for wizard spells. And I have someone who can do spirit spells too if you re desperate."
Uniana says, "That's it. That's the tweet."
Ithilwyn grins at Uniana.
Agathilea applauds Uniana.
Valyrka grins at Uniana.
Speaking to Uniana, Arianiss says, "I really appreciate that, thank you."
Vyctus says, "And if she happens to kill you by spelling you up, I'm not resposible."
Speaking to Uniana, Yardie asks, "Thank you for coming to your TED Talk?"
Uniana says, "I don't want people to opt out of Vaalor cuz no spells."
You say, "... does the OSA news mean I'll have no exscuse to not be on a boat? Can I just be that elf clinging to the mast and complaining bitterly the whole time? I'll do it."
Krystalena says, "I'm always available for spirit spells. I know they're not as useful as wizards, but they're something."
You say, ""You've all got Troll's Blood you're fine I hate this boat!"."
Amalexia says, "I'll do the same, with regard to spells, though I'm a bit more surly than Uniana."
Arenglae says, "Same... if you can find me... so good luck."


Valyrka exclaims, "You!"
Valyrka nods at Quando.
Quando says, "I have two sorta related questions."
Valyrka asks, "Are they married or just cousins?"
Quando says, "Second cousins."
Quando nods at Valyrka.
Valyrka nods.
<b>Quando says, "Can we remove the fog/locate moratorium from Ta'vaalor so that it's easier to get deaders back to town and to find dead locksmiths in town? Can we add some kind of Lornon place in town for paladin's dead teleporter thing to work? It's not much help sending them to a different hunting ground when you find them. Sheru would be nice, if you're taking suggestions."</b>
Quando says, "See, kinda the same family."
Valyrka says, "Changing those things will most likely not happen."
Quando asks, "No locating bodies in town?"
Krystalena says, "You can locate in town."
You say, "You can locate in town? And fog takes you right to the gate."
Valyrka says, "But I can look into the paladin thing maybe someplace sneaky."
Krystalena says, "I do it."
Quando says, "Eh, I always get the unpresenced thing."
Aureliano says, "116 definitely works in town."
Quando asks, "When you locate someone that is in town?"
Aureliano says, "Yes."
Quando says, "I don't believe it."
Valyrka says, "I was confused on the question."
Quando says, "But I'll accept it for now."
Valyrka says, "You should be able to do it in town."
Quando says, "So, you just can't fog to people in town."
Krystalena says, "I cast locate then look at the map to figure out what street they're on."
Valyrka says, "No transporting into town."
Orssus says, "Fortress thing."
You say, "It's the same reason that the wards block most aggressive spells."
Talimiir says, "It's like creating checkpoints, then ways around the checkpoints."
Quando says, "Ugh...I hate dragging you losers that die all the time."
Illumiada asks, "If I may, sometimes I am needed from Illistim. Perhaps an exception to the fortress could be made? From those traveling from the sister city?"
Valyrka says, "While I like that we are making the town more welcoming, there needs to be some of the fortress left in it."
Dharana says, "Hmm, CHE Pins will transport you into Dancing Dachre, but they put you back outside town when you leave your annex."
Arianiss asks, "What about a way citizens / partial citizens could fog in/out?"
Talimiir says, "While YOU may mean well, that would create a loophole that those of nefarious intent could exploit."
Orssus says, "Making an exception for citizens and partial citzens sounds like complex coding."
Agathilea asks, "Is it possible to use Ravelin for fogging purposes in rescues?"
Valyrka says, "For now I would say a no, since there are more things we need like osa and hunting."
Krystalena says, "It wouldn't make sense for people to be able to teleport into a military base. All sorts of bad security if so."
Orssus says, "There's a reason they finally closed the door into the catacombs/sewers."
Teveriel sternly says, "Permit, please."
Valyrka says, "So eat your wheaties and drag."
Agathilea grins at Valyrka.
Valyrka asks, "You cannot drag a gnome?"
Krystalena says, "If Krystalena can drag a dead giantkin..."
Valyrka asks, "Roll them maybe?"
Quando says, "I can, but I'll have to hire a whole sled of them to drag me."
Valyrka says, "Oh so roll him."
Krystalena says, "Could just get the cleric to come to them."
Orssus says, "I've never had a problem dragging people.."
Valyrka says, "Sorry that is not the answer you would like."


Valyrka turns to face Lynaera.
Valyrka exclaims, "You!"
Lynaera smiles at Valyrka.
Speaking to Valyrka, Lynaera exclaims, "I will continue the tradition of two quick questions!"
<b>Lynaera says, "My many characters often give people tours around Ta'Vaalor, showing points of interest, and also neat little hidden details and areas...."</b>
Valyrka grins.
<b>Speaking to Valyrka, Lynaera asks, "One such "hidden area" is the burghal enclave. Most people here know about it, but many folk are surprised that we have a little undercity. Would we be able to get any messaging in the town that alludes to the enclave's existance?"</b>
Lynesi says, "Gonna invade gnome space."
Lynaera says, "I know they are sneaky, but it'd be nice to have more flavor."
Speaking to Lynaera, Talimiir says, "They're tiny. There's room."
Valyrka says, "My non-elven dude in TI has a brother moving here."
Speaking to Lynaera, Orssus says, "That's a good idea, I don't believe we have any ambient messaging about the gnomes here at all."
Valyrka says, "But yes I can look into that."
Lynaera says, "And the other question.."
Lynaera whispers something to Valyrka.
Orssus says, "Secret question."
Speaking to Lynaera, Talimiir accuses, "That's cheaating."
Lynaera says, "Best question."
Speaking to Lynaera, Valyrka says, "Thanks for letting me know."
Valyrka winks.
Valyrka turns to face Rmalie.
Valyrka starts chortling.
Orssus says, "Now it's like Lost in Translation, we'll never know what she whispered."


<b>Rmalie softly asks, "My question was about the treaty in Icemule--exploring development of that. I wanted to know also if your updates will include changes to NPC's already here?"</b>
Valyrka asks, "Which npc's do you want to see changes in?"
Rmalie softly says, "Well....Coleesta is having an affair or three....."
Rmalie softly says, "And the lady in the guild....She needs to get out more..."
Rmalie softly says, "And....the bank teller is rather prim."
Teveriel wryly says, "Hey, but."
Teveriel asks, "Remember the laundress?"
Rmalie softly says, "And we need a knitting club."
Valyrka says, "So some of our npcs can use a change since they have been doing the same thing for 30 years or something."
Rmalie softly repeats, "KNITTING."
Teveriel exclaims, "Bring back the laundress!"
Valyrka asks, "What did happen to her?"
Ithilwyn softly exclaims, "Yes!"
Valyrka asks, "Wasn't she killed?"
Speaking to Teveriel, Lynaera exclaims, "The laundress is still live in plat!!!"
Teveriel says, "She's still in Plat. I dunno."
Ithilwyn softly says, "Tea and knitting at the court."
Teveriel says, "She was part of that.. uh, character background system that never really took off."
Rmalie softly says, "And a yarn shop."
Valyrka says, "Added to the look into list."
Valyrka says, "I can note that GM Auchand and I tossed around a system where when there is an invasion all the shops close and the npcs scatter."
Aureliano says, "Interesting.."
You say, "I love that idea."
Krystalena says, "That would make sense."
Rmalie softly says, "That is a great idea."
Valyrka says, "So the guards are not standing there looking stupid."
Krystalena exclaims, "Yes!"
Valyrka says, "That is far out but something we did play with."
Orssus says, "The guards talking about one day having a farm, while a horde of undead are attacking."
Speaking to Orssus, Lynaera says, "Hey, how many invasions have they seen at this point? They know we'll save them."
Krystalena says, "The drunk one at Amaranth really bugs me."
Valyrka turns to face Dharana.
Krystalena says, "He gives a really bad impression there. He should be at one of the other gates."
Valyrka exclaims, "And you are up!"
Orssus says, "Maybe just change it to a speech impediment."
Dharana says, "I have a youngster sort of question."
Valyrka says, "Sure thing."
Vyctus asks, "Hasn't he been drunk awhile?"
Agathilea says, "Never sobered up."


<b>Dharana says, "As a very young monk, besides not having an invoker... I run into issues getting my kickers and grabbers blessed."</b>
Speaking to Vyctus, Krystalena says, "Years."
Valyrka asks, "Do pure potions work on them?"
<b>Dharana says, "I appreciate all the spells in King's Court, but I carry four sets of gear to be able to hunt for my Voln steps."</b>
Orssus says, "They should."
Arianiss says, "Pure potions is an expensive way to do that though."
Valyrka says, "Are they sold in the city."
Dharana says, "Pretty sure I can't afford pure potions at level 10."
Vyctus says, "Okay, I took a minute to figure out what kickers and grabbers were, that took me a bit."
Krystalena says, "They're sold here in the cleric back room."
Orssus says, "About 11k a pop."
Rmalie softly asks, "How expensive are they?"
Rmalie softly says, "Oh."
Pilatherel says, "Yeah that's very expensive for a level 10."
Amalexia says, "That shouldn't be an issue for much longer once the 304 and 330 changes go live."
<b>Dharana says, "So I was wondering if there would be a way to add an NPC to bless weapons."</b>
Dharana says, "Even if I have to walk all the way to Voln for it."
Agathilea says, "I just ask on the help channel."
Agathilea says, "Usually someone is available here, Illy, or Mist Harbor."
Dharana says, "And it took me about 45 minutes to walk to the Landing the other day, so going there doesn't work."
Valyrka says, "I can ask, but I would not be too, but I a doubtful."
Valyrka says, "Ugh ok."
Dharana says, "I'm on very random times."
Valyrka says, "I can ask, but I would be doubtful."
Valyrka says, "Maybe if I did not have two thoughts in my head."
Talimiir says, "I'm sure this is where Krys is going, but I also have a cleric available- if you need blessing, you can hit me up on Discord. Krys is probably available for that too."
Dharana says, "Aye, well yes, I hate to alway be whining for a bless."
Valyrka says, "Torbot always offers as well I think."
Orssus says, "Eventually you'll be able to voln bless them."
Dharana says, "And the new blessing system should help that."
Krystalena says, "Torbot does."
Arianiss says, "With 10 ranks of blessings lore you can double the blesses with Consecrate."
Dharana says, "Torbot is amazing."
Talimiir says, "I can help with the consecrate."
Talimiir says, "So I can cons them, then have my cleric bless them."
Talimiir says, "We can two-fer it."
Valyrka says, "And hopefully if we can draw some folks back it will help."
Dharana says, "Those are amazing offers. Thank you all."
Talimiir smiles at Dharana.
Speaking to Dharana, Talimiir says, "That's how Vaalor works."


Valyrka turns to face Arianiss.
Valyrka exclaims, "You are up!"
<b>Arianiss says, "I have 4 things, but 2 of them are statements."</b>
<b>Speaking to Valyrka, Arianiss says, "1) You're awesome."</b>
Valyrka blushes a glowing shade of red.
<b>Arianiss asks, "2) As the GM over Vaalor and Illistim are you wanting to achieve a bit of a blend between the two places, or are you wanting to keep things separate? Not necessarily with events and NPCs and what not, but working on systems with both places in mind. If we can find ways to benefit both places with our suggestions, does that help you?"</b>
Valyrka says, "I want them to remain unique."
Valyrka says, "But."
Valyrka says, "There is no reason why events cannot cross over if it makes sense."
Valyrka says, "The mirror and king are on very good terms."
Valyrka says, "No, they are not getting married."
Uniana asks, "How *good*?"
Uniana asks, "How lonely is the king?"
Uniana says, "You know for reasons."
Laermeluion says, "I'm hoping to elevate the Military's fashion...'."
<b>Arianiss says, "3) This is more a Valyrka thing than a Vaalor thing. Conrash recently did a Fireside Tales with the Mentors where he went in depth on links between Zul Logoth and Icemule and Cavernhold. It was very impressive. You have the elven village. I know GM Auchand has also dropped little mentions about a trail between Icemule and Illistim. I also think Icemule would be a good place to have an Illistim embassy (the Mirror hates Wehn, the Village is too small, Solhaven is likely still out at this time, and so Icemule makes sense as a place to start to further Valley of Gold stuff). I know that Auchand is doing his thing, and you want to do your thing so this is more of just awareness that there are a large number of hooks out there to bridge East and West further. However, this is also a very sensitive subject among players so I know it's hard to be aggressive with it."</b>
You say, "The cities are close enough to see Ta'Vaalor from Ta'Illistim, so it makes sense to work together sometimes."<b></b>
<b>Arianiss asks, "4) I know you said the Icemule/Vaalor treaty is low down on your list. Is this something that Icemule should back burner too or does Auchand have the ability to be, say, King Qalinor for this?"</b>
Valyrka says, "No need to back burner."
Valyrka says, "I just know there was talk of what was going to happen to the elven village."
Arianiss says, "That's all."
Arianiss smiles.
Valyrka says, "And things have take a turn with that project but it is there."
Valyrka says, "I cannot comment on the trail thing."
Valyrka says, "If I know somthing I am sure you will too."
Arianiss says, "Yeah, that's more just an awareness thing.. I'm seeing lots of little ways that East/West bridging can be explored."
Valyrka says, "There will be some twists coming up that no one has seen."
You squint at Valyrka.
Valyrka says, "After eg as Eg is about to take over."
Valyrka says, "There are two different things happening shortly after eg."
Valyrka says, "So be on the lookout."
Laermeluion says, "Almost already has, that opening of the storyline had a bunch of us thinking there was an invasion."
Vyctus hopefully suggests, "Aaaannd after my wedding...?"
Valyrka grins.
Arianiss exclaims, "The eel invasions have been fun!"
Valyrka says, "I wonder if the eels can come here."
Krystalena says, "Up the river."
Arianiss says, "Mutated land-eels."
Valyrka says, "We will see."
Rmalie softly asks, "Eels?"
Valyrka says, "Sneaky gms."
Agathilea says, "Bring em."


Valyrka turns to face Amalexia.
Valyrka exclaims, "My lady you are up!"
Valyrka grins.
<b>Amalexia says, "Though, this isn't a big TV thing."</b>
<b>Amalexia asks, "But perhaps we can hear more from the other City-States?"</b>
Valyrka says, "Perhaps we can."
Valyrka nods at Amalexia.
Valyrka says, "Gelynne needs to send a letter home."
You let out a cheer!
Valyrka says, "I also need to let Gasen out to bother the TV women."
Krystalena says, "He should come to drill sometime."
Valyrka says, "But yes, I agree."
Valyrka says, "He talked."
Ithilwyn softly says, "I miss Gassen."
Ithilwyn grins.


Teveriel clears his throat.
<b>Teveriel recites:</b>
 <b>"This was already touched upon briefly, but I just wanted to say that I think there's a lot of opportunity for more player participation in the non-military aspects of Ta'Vaalor culture. I'd love to learn more about the Council of Regents and maybe see about some direct or indirect player involvement there. If not necessarily serving ON the council, then perhaps taking on some aides or other advisory roles. I know I can't be the only one who'd be interested in this type of RP. I think it's a natural line of progression for those who don't necessarily want to get involved with the day-to-day military life roleplay but still have great interest in the Vaalor culture."</b>
<b>Teveriel adds, "Thank you for coming to my Tev Talk."</b>
Valyrka agrees with Teveriel.
Valyrka grins.
Valyrka says, "I agree."
Arlerathen says, "Sounds like they want what the Argent Mirror has."
Valyrka says, "I would love more non-mililtary ways for folks to be involved."
Amalexia says, "The Argent Mirror has a harem."
Valyrka says, "The King does not want handmaidens."
Ithilwyn softly says, "That would be...awkward."
Valyrka says, "No stupid girls in his room."
Amalexia asks, "Or was that the Argent Lady?"
Speaking to Valyrka, you ask, "Are you suuuuuure?"
Valyrka says, "Very."
Uniana says, "I think the Empire stuff does a good job of supporting noble families. I would love to see that here."
Amalexia says, "Handlads, then."
Valyrka says, "He is a bachelor."
Krystalena says, "Our Sovereign isn't a player."
You say, "EN's most elegiable bachlor."
Uniana says, "For NOW."
Speaking to Valyrka, Arenglae says, "Which is WHY he should have ALL the ladies in his room."
Valyrka blinks.
Valyrka says, "Dear goddess who would wish than on anyone."
Valyrka says, "He would never get any sleep with all the gabbing."
Arenglae says, "Next time on Bachelor: Ta'Vaalor."
Uniana says, "I don't want to be -a- queen, I want to be *the* queen."
Valyrka smirks.
Agathilea sighs at Uniana.



Valyrka turns to face Krystalena.
Valyrka exclaims, "Now you!"
<b>Speaking to Valyrka, Krystalena asks, "My question is about the ambient messages. There was mention at changing them. Do you see that happening soon? At the very least, can we stop shooting at the half-elf that stole the bread?"</b>
Valyrka asks, "Are they still doing that?"
Arlerathen says, "Murdering that kid is the best ambient noise though."
Valyrka says, "Ugh."
Valyrka says, "I thought I got that one."
Krystalena says, "Yes, along with the half-elf being called a mutt."
Valyrka says, "Whenever you see one send me a note please."
You say, "The one about the guards shoving the dark elf around is still firing too."
Krystalena says, "Will do."
Krystalena asks, "Can we stop the Vaalor scream from shouting our names, too?"
Valyrka asks, "Is that a citizenverb?"
Uniana says, "No I like it."
Agathilea exclaims, "I like my name!"
Vyctus asks, "I mean, does it SAY he dies?"
Laermeluion says, "I like screaming my name."
Ithilwyn softly says, "I like it."
Agathilea belts out in Common, "Rassine!" A look of renewed pride overcomes her expression.
Krystalena says, "Only instead of that, it says our name."
Agathilea says, "There it is."
You say, "Show offs."
(Arlerathen belts out in Common, "I'm only here because my tree city doesn't actually exist!")
Agathilea says, "You bolster your morale with a Vaalor call to arms, belting out in Common, "Rassine!"."
Krystalena says, "There it is."
Agathilea nods at Valyrka.
Valyrka says, "I can look at it."
You say, "Wow though ... I actually like that."
Valyrka says, "So you do not ant to scream your own name."
Krystalena says, "No."
Agathilea says, "I do too."
Laermeluion says, "Maybe make it something you can toggle."
Agathilea says, "Perhaps."
You say, "I mean, it's not your name, it's your family name."
Talimiir says, "A toggle."
Laermeluion says, "I want to still be able to scream for "Aran'Naith."
You say, "Which I imagine that a lot of elves have great pride in."
Valyrka says, "I can look into it to add a toggle."
Agathilea says, "I do."
Agathilea nods to you.
Laermeluion says, "There's a reason I have my family crest all over me."
Krystalena says, "Yes, it's random."</pre>

Speaking to Valyrka, Vyctus exclaims, "Thank you for taking the time to meet with us!"
Valyrka says, "I have made lists and lists."
Ithilwyn softly says, "Thank you for having this."
Valyrka says, "I am always open to feedback."
Amalexia says, "Can we retake ShadowGuard sometime? I'm bored and want to kick undead in the jimmies."
Speaking to Valyrka, Talimiir says, "You should have given special juice-boxes as gifts."
Valyrka says, "If I am sucking please tell me."
Speaking to Valyrka, Aureliano exclaims, "Thanks for your time tonight!"
Speaking to Valyrka, Dharana exclaims, "Thank you for the time. I learned a lot tonight!"

Valyrka says, "My pc grew up here."

Valyrka winks at Teveriel.

Valyrka says, "Everyone is always welcome."
Valyrka says, "I like all input."
Valyrka says, "Thank you all for your thoughts and your kindess tonight."
