Set apart from the rest of the tree, the circular room is supported by a buttressed platform.  Long fronds from a multitude of tropical plants are layered over a wooden frame creating a shady canopy above.  Small glaes lanterns hang from the rim holding bright candles that illuminate the floor below.  A sturdy railing encloses the area, rich green vines twining about each spindle.  Carved from tanik, a large desk with matching chair looms against an outer barrier with several cushioned benches scattered nearby.  You also see the Yardie disk, a large crystal cart with some stuff on it, an elven body, an elven body, a bloody severed head, a scrawny elven body laying in a pool of blood, a small rose-covered arch and a crayon-scribbled coloring book.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "And let you share your ideas and what you would like to see from us." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "We have established regular RP night which have had a variety of interactions between players and NPC's.  Many topics and themes have been explored." </span></b>

Mazreth holds up a sign that says "APPLAUSE"

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Coffee and teas that were created by players are stocked in Casu's. They are awesome." </span></b>

Agathilea applauds.

Krystalena applauds.

Aendir points at Mazreth and jeers.  Boooooo!

Aphaedra applauds.

Esana nods approvingly.

Esana applauds.

Agathilea nods.

Mazreth adopts an agreeable expression.

The dim aura fades from around Krystalena.

The opalescent aura fades from around Krystalena.

Krystalena appears less confident.

The air shivers about Krystalena, glistening faintly before stilling to normalcy.

Krystalena begins to breathe less deeply.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "I took player suggestions and changed up the level of creatures at each gate which prompted more use of the drake and more PC's able to participate against those harder critters." </span></b>

Krystalena lets out a cheer!

Agathilea applauds loudly.

Agathilea nods at Valyrka.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "The excitement when someone hit a critter with it was great." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka grins. </span></b>

Agathilea grins.

Agathilea hoots.

Krystalena says, "Best weapon in Elanthia."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Of course." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "The port and OSA opened with days of invasions and other events leading up to it." </span></b>

Aphaedra lets out a cheer!

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Everyone who participated was amazing, we had a great team of gm's working together and you all made it fun." </span></b>

Tylanthriel grins.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "'Players also had the chance to leave their mark and submit names for the port and partial and full citizens had a vote in the name." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "They were great names." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "But." </span></b>

Agathilea glances at Teveriel.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka applauds Teveriel. </span></b>

Agathilea applauds Teveriel.

Teveriel rocks back on his heels.

Teveriel smiles.

Raatar flutters his wings at Teveriel.

Aendir nods respectfully at Teveriel.

Speaking to Teveriel, Aendir says, "You did good."

Aendir says, "Very proud."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Looking in on all of you, there has been a huge increase in player directed roleplay including Wyvern Wednesdays, warcamp raids, bandit nights, and Crimson Legion talks and drill nights." </span></b>

Teveriel demurs, "Aw, shucks. Thanks."

Aendir begins to flirt with Teveriel.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "You are the blood of the city and your creativity is amazing.  Thank you for everything you do." </span></b>

Agathilea smiles.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Looking ahead." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "In the immediate future there is a new shop coming to town.  I will wait until a Monday RP night to engage you more about it." </span></b>

Vaatar says, "Some of us did not know you were watching."

Raatar glances at Agathilea.

Krystalena says, "Oooo."

The dim aura fades from around you.

Yardie snickers at Raatar.

Your breathing becomes more shallow.

Aphaedra rubs her snow lily handflower.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "We always watch..." </span></b>

Agathilea squints.

Speaking to Raatar, Mazreth says, "Someone is always watching."

Aendir gulps.

Mazreth grins.

Agathilea squints at Mazreth.

Mazreth points at Agathilea.

Speaking to <b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka, Yardie says, "That's....oh dear."</span></b>

Mazreth nods slowly.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Except the jungle room.  No one watches the jungleroom." </span></b>

Agathilea grins at Mazreth.

Speaking to a scrawny elven body laying in a pool of blood, Stormfather says, "Hear that? They always watch."

Aphaedra grins at Yardie.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka covers her eyes with her hands. </span></b>

Stormfather glances at an elven body and makes a little purring sound.

Xynwen says, "Except by accident."

Sorlu says, "Sometimes it's Sorlu that's watching."

Agathilea begins chuckling at Valyrka!

Xynwen bursts into tears!

Sorlu grins.

Krystalena says, "A song by Sting comes to mind."

Aphaedra says, "Only if you have something to be ashamed of."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka rubs Xynwen. </span></b>

Teveriel says, "Thankfully, we don't have a jungle room."

Xynwen is still scarred.

Agathilea hugs Xynwen.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka slowly empties her lungs. </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Whew." </span></b>

Speaking nervously to Aphaedra, Yardie says, "Shame?  Never."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "I know." </span></b>

Agathilea nods sympathetically at Xynwen.

Yardie fidgets.

Teveriel says, "We don't do that here."

Aendir says, "Yet."

Teveriel hesitantly asks, "Right?"

Agathilea says, "We don't."

Agathilea nods firmly at Teveriel.

Aendir says, "It's my next business venture."

Aphaedra says, "GMs are always welcome to raise rating cards."

Aphaedra snickers.

Aphaedra leans on Yardie, giving him a companionable grin.

Teveriel grins at Agathilea.

Yardie snickers at Aphaedra.

Speaking to Mazreth, Zoelle says, "They don't call me stalker extraodinare for nothing."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Believe me we donot want to see any of that." </span></b>

Aliashyrah honestly says, "This recap is making me wanting to come visit more often. Sounds like you all are doing some fun things."

Raatar grins at Zoelle.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Aliashyrah. </span></b>

Sorlu grins at Aliashyrah.

Mazreth agrees with Zoelle.

Teveriel says, "You absolutely should."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "There is some roleplay between Ta'Vaalor and Icemule Trace going on right now.  It has been interesting to see the reactions and interactions that has come out of it." </span></b>

Speaking to Raatar, Mazreth says, "She's scary."

As Mazreth playfully cowers away from Zoelle, she waves a hand at Mazreth dismissively, then winks in his direction.

Raatar grins at Mazreth.

Tylanthriel nods at Valyrka.

Sorlu smiles.

Raatar says, "So is Agathilea."

Agathilea stares at Raatar.

Yardie nods at Raatar.

Aendir asks, "Are we going to take over it and call it New Ta'Vaalor?"

Agathilea stares at Yardie.

Sorlu says, "The Icemule-Ta'Vaalor cross-realm RP has been pretty amazing."

Yardie forces a grin at Agathilea and laughs nervously.

Sorlu glares at Aendir.

Aliashyrah nods in agreement at Sorlu.

Aendir grins.

Speaking to Aendir, Mazreth says, "I think Ta'Vaalor West was what was being kicked around."

Mazreth winks.

Raatar grins.

Aphaedra says, "I was thinking Vaalor Norde."

Speaking to Sorlu, Mazreth says, "It really has been amazing."

Raatar giggles at Mazreth.

Speaking to Mazreth, Aendir exclaims, "Sign me up!"

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "The future of it is still out there." </span></b>

Yardie muses, "Can't blame the Faendryl this time."

Aliashyrah says, "Loved seeing someone come from over here to checkin on the hooligans in Icemule."

Aliashyrah says, "It created a fun moment."

Raatar agrees with Yardie.

Speaking to Yardie, Tylanthriel says, "This time."

Tylanthriel winks at Yardie.

Yardie snickers at Tylanthriel.

Agathilea grins at Tylanthriel.

Speaking to Yardie, Mazreth says, "We can always blame the Faendryl."

Speaking to Yardie, Esana says, "Nah, we blame them for breaking and entering."

Yardie gasps.

Sorlu grins at Mazreth.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Uniana has agreed to carry all the snow over here for us to enjoy." </span></b>

Krystalena laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.

Aphaedra cackles at Esana!

The voice of Jaderain huskily says, "We are usually to blame."

Speaking nervously to Esana, Yardie says, "....that was different."

Speaking to Yardie, Alcarinque asks, "And jumping on beds?"

Alcarinque shrugs.

Aliashyrah chuckles.

Teveriel says, "Rather establish a base in the Hinterwilds. Keep an eye on ol' boy while he sleeps."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "So more to come." </span></b>

Speaking quietly to Alcarinque, Yardie asks, "It's...fun?"

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "There is a global story coming in 2023.  It has something for everyone." </span></b>

Krystalena agrees with Yardie.

Agathilea turns an inquisitive ear toward Valyrka.

Aphaedra says, "Ooo."

Aendir says, "A global story huh."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "By 2023 I mean early 2023 so keep eyes peeled." </span></b>

Mazreth rubs his hands together slowly.

Zoelle peels her eyes.

Agathilea glances at Mazreth.

Yardie glances at Zoelle and shivers.

Speaking to Zoelle, Mazreth asks, "You might finally get to kill someone?"

Speaking to Mazreth, Alcarinque says, "That's not encouraging."

Speaking to Mazreth, Krystalena asks, "Lots of havoc and death?"

Agathilea grins at Zoelle.

Zoelle begins to twitch.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Lot's of stuff." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods. </span></b>

Raatar flutters his wings wildly.  He knows they're attached, right?

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "While it is not a Ta'Vaalor document, I will mention a group of GM's are actively working on a document about Ta'Loenthra." </span></b>

Aendir smiles.

Agathilea nods understandingly.

Aendir says, "Very cool."

Teveriel nods in agreement.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "I have a second document being worked on that I will keep to myself for now for reasons.  And that is all I can say about that." </span></b>

Stormfather raises an eyebrow.

The voice of Jaderain huskily says, "That is the one to worry about."

In a flash of forest green light, an ethereal doe dashes out of Yardie's ghezyte bracelet, fading into the distance.

Agathilea grins at Valyrka.

Raatar giggles.

Aendir asks, "Divergence 2.0?"

Yardie chuckles.

Aendir says, "You heard it here first."

Speaking to Aendir, Stormfather says, "Kama Sutra. Safer topic."

Aendir begins chuckling at Stormfather!

Thandiwe nods at Valyrka.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Umm no throwing that on me." </span></b>

Aliashyrah gazes in amusement at Stormfather.

Aendir snickers at Valyrka.

Speaking to Stormfather, Mazreth says, "I think you need the Erithi meeting for that."

Teveriel says, "We already had someone make references to certain Erithian texts."

Aphaedra grins at Stormfather.

Teveriel gazes heavenward.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "I am the last person you want to code something complex." </span></b>

Xynwen examines her fingernails.

Mazreth points at Teveriel.

Speaking to Mazreth, Stormfather says, "I'm a god. Not THE god. Just A god."

Esana smirks at Teveriel.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "And." </span></b>

Teveriel mutters, "So flexible."

Uniana gags.

Aliashyrah begins chuckling at Teveriel!

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "There is a new citizenship title system for all towns is in the works." </span></b>

Yardie blinks at Valyrka.

Speaking to Teveriel, Esana says, "And bendy."

Stormfather says, "Oh? That's neat."

Speaking to Valyrka, Yardie says, "Oh that's right."

Teveriel shudders.

Speaking to Teveriel, Krystalena says, "My mind was wandering the same direction."

Thandiwe grins at Yardie.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "So more to look forward to in the new year." </span></b>

Thandiwe touches one finger to her lips.

Thandiwe winks at Yardie.

Agathilea smiles at Valyrka.

Yardie grins at Thandiwe.

Thandiwe chuckles.

Aphaedra ponders.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Before I throw myself to the lio... I mean you all." </span></b>


<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka exclaims, "Oh back up!" </span></b>

Aendir says, "Rar."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Yes please." </span></b>

Speaking to himself, Mazreth says, "I hope I can get the title bum."

Aphaedra grins at Mazreth.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Elaboration is good." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Thandiwe. </span></b>

Speaking in Elven, you say, "We all already know that, you don't need a title."

Speaking to Mazreth, Aphaedra says, "Just laze about as hard as you can."

Thandiwe says, "The new Citizenship title system is something that Netz suggested and Xynwen molded and then I fiddled and now Naiken is coding."

Mazreth gawks at you.

You are now speaking Common.

Mazreth says, "You wound me."

Thandiwe asks, "I got that right in the right order, yes?"

Thandiwe peers quizzically at Xynwen.

Agathilea applauds Thandiwe.

You examine your fingernails.

Xynwen nods at Thandiwe.

Xynwen grins.

Mazreth grins at Esana.

Xynwen says, "So much suggestive molding and fiddling."

Xynwen stares off into space.

Thandiwe says, "It will allow citizens to be "of Ta'Vaalor" or to have "the Vaalorian"."

You cover your ears.

Speaking to Xynwen, Aendir says, "My head was in the same place."

Agathilea smiles at Thandiwe.

Thandiwe says, "But you could also be "Denizen of Neartofar"."

Thandiwe says, "Citizen of the Fortress."

Thandiwe says, "Stuff like that."

Teveriel says, "Oh, good."

Uniana says, "Baller."

Krystalena says, "Interesting."

Teveriel says, "I was about to say."

Xynwen says, "The Wyvern Pacifist Who Only Drinks Tea And Loves Halflings."

Aendir says, "Wilver of Shanty Town."

Stormfather says, "Neat."

Xynwen says, "Oh wait, that one was nixed."

You hear someone snicker.

Aphaedra grins at Xynwen.

Casil plays the Mandalorion theme on the air guitar.

Agathilea grins at Casil.

Speaking to Casil, Teveriel says, "This is the Way."

Thandiwe says, "So it will be pretty expansive when it is finished, but we will introduce it slowly."

Tylanthriel nods at Thandiwe.

Mazreth asks, "The coward of the fortress then?"

Thandiwe says, "Right now, we are working on quarterly releases, but we will see how the year goes."

You hear someone making some odd, exasperated noises.

Agathilea says, "Sounds good."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "So fun things coming." </span></b>

Agathilea nods at Thandiwe.

Zoelle and Elysani bump fists, both ending the gesture with synchronized explosion sounds.

Elysani flashes a quick grin.

Agathilea grins at Elysani.

Speaking to Zoelle, Yardie mouths, "I need something like that."

Raatar flutters his wings at Zoelle.

Speaking to Yardie, Zoelle mouths, "Apply to be a GM then."

Speaking to Yardie, Tylanthriel says, "For us, everytime we get put on the scouting team and it's just us."

Agathilea nods sagely at Yardie.

Krystalena says, "So many GMs."

Krystalena gazes in wonder at her surroundings.

Speaking to Tylanthriel, Yardie says, "We need a name for our duo."

Elysani and Zoelle bump fists, both ending the gesture with synchronized explosion sounds.

Tylanthriel says, "Agreed."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "And the last thing from me is a thank you to all the gms who have been popping in to events, jumping in when volunteers are asked for and having a great time with me.  Killing you all is more fun wih friends." </span></b>

Agathilea cackles!

Tylanthriel chuckles.

Krystalena laughs!

Agathilea says, "Yes, thank you all."

Aphaedra grins.

Sorlu snickers.

Agathilea says, "As if she needed help killing us."

Agathilea glances at Valyrka.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka smirks. </span></b>

Mazreth asks, "Someone needs help?"

Mazreth grins at Agathilea.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "But it is fun... share the wealth and all that." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Before I let you ask me I have a question for you all." </span></b>

Speaking to Mazreth, Agathilea says, "Not really, I just look tough, but fall like a marshmallow."

Teveriel says, "It has been enjoyable being killed by Maz, but even more fun decimating his orcish hordes."

Mazreth chuckles.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Our lovely orcs." </span></b>

Raatar giggles at Agathilea.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka sighs. </span></b>

Casil glances at Teveriel.

Speaking to Teveriel, Zoelle says, "And me too, I help."

Aendir turns an inquisitive ear toward Valyrka.

Speaking to Teveriel, Casil says, "Most of those deaths were me."

Speaking to Agathilea, Krystalena says, "Squishy."

Agathilea squints at Valyrka.

Casil grins at Teveriel.

Agathilea asks, "Orcs?"

Agathilea nods in agreement at Krystalena.

Teveriel exclaims, "Fine! You're all great!"

(Zoelle stabs Teveriel a few times with her noble sword.)

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka asks, "Monday night rp.  Are there any topics/interactions etc. you want to see more of or that has not been done?" </span></b>

Teveriel says, "Ow."

Agathilea scowls.

Uniana raises her hand.

Mazreth frowns at Teveriel.

ardie mouths, "Nature's Fury."

Speaking to Teveriel, Aphaedra says, "Nice knowing you, bro."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Uniana. </span></b>

Agathilea turns an inquisitive ear toward Uniana.

Stormfather raises his hand.

Speaking to Teveriel, Mazreth says, "Challenge accepted."

Esana raises her hand.

Uniana says, "I don't feel like the RP Monday nights are frequently offering anything more than what is happening by the player-run evenings and that fact often feels as though it's putting them in direct conflict with each other. NPC shows up says "hey you heard about this thing? or let's talk about this thing" which is often what the purpose of Wednesday is or the talks that Iskandr has been hosting, except we don't have GM resources. I put a lot of time into hosting WW whether that be collecting items for prizes/interaction or thinking up new games or writing non-official lore and it's a dirty way to put it but if I can do all that for the sake of the community, I would expect the same from those who are overseeing it on the staff side as well."

Agathilea glances between Mazreth and Teveriel.

Teveriel says, "I forgot my gauntlets, otherwise I'd throw 'em down."

Mazreth starts taking notes on open implosion and nature's fury.

Agathilea's face turns slightly pale.

(Agathilea hopes Mazreth's pen runs out of ink.)

Agathilea folds her arms over her chest.

Aliashyrah nods slowly at Sorlu.

Speaking to Mazreth, Alcarinque says, "Don't forget Song of Sonic Disruption."

Krystalena says, "Dang, open implosion..."

Mazreth nods at Alcarinque.

Alcarinque nods at Mazreth.

The voice of Jaderain huskily says, "Quite exciting."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka asks, "We have been overlapping events or ideas?" </span></b>

Speaking to Alcarinque, Teveriel exclaims, "Whose side are you on!"

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "I am just trying to make sure I understand." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "And what would you like to see happening on those nights then." </span></b>

Alcarinque turns to face Teveriel.

Alcarinque points at Mazreth.

Teveriel mutters bitterly.

Thandiwe asks, "If I may?"

Thandiwe cocks her head at <b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka.</span></b>

Thandiwe cocks her head at Uniana.

Uniana says, "Of course."

Jaderain suddenly fades into view.

Aphaedra becomes solid again.

The brilliant luminescence fades from around Aphaedra.

The bright luminescence fades from around Aphaedra.

The silvery luminescence fades from around Aphaedra.

The glowing specks of energy surrounding Aphaedra suddenly shoot off in all directions, then quickly fade away.

Aphaedra seems a bit less imposing.

Thandiwe says, "I think what Uniana is trying to say, please correct me if I'm wrong, is that she feels as though some of the excitement that can be handled by GM's creating RP moments is missing from the interactions that happen on Mondays.  They feel "player run" to her and not connected to an indepth, globe changing moment and/or don't feel personally touching.  I can not speak for the past, but I can say that with the Ice Mule interactions, the new Global Storyline, things are changing and all of these little subtle moments that Valyrka is creating are to build for when the changes hit."

Thandiwe says, "That way, when we do start working towards change, it will feel disruptive and different."

Uniana asks, "That is exactly that. And if I can continue in that vein?"

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Please do." </span></b>

Uniana says, "I say this with respect to know I that on the Icemule side this is being heavily driven by players and I want to support that and I want to encourage that, but on the Vaalorian side I am not at all interested in once more having Vaalor being painted as the villians because they are a super power.  I saw it destroy the community when GMs who weren't familiar with the community came in during the GSS for a global storyline and our community is in a very fragile state, at best."

Aphaedra returns to normal color.

Uniana says, "It's polarizing and the kind of storylines we need in Vaalor are once that give people a reason to come here under healthy conditions.  This is also why I'm not so thrilled about a world-wide storyline involving Vaalor. Vaalor and the other City-States and the groups that live east of the spine deserve more culture and community building lore that creates a unique environment that celebrates all kinds. I'm very much looking forward to the Loenthra document."

The dim aura fades from around Tylanthriel.

Jaderain nods in agreement.

Stormfather says, "The 'big empire/state is bad' is an old trope i'd like to see done away with also."

Speaking to Uniana, Sorlu asks, "Can you explain what you mean by "healthy conditions"?"

Raatar flutters his wings, stirring the air slightly.

Uniana asks, "Not because a distant village feels under threat of attack?"

Uniana grins wryly.

Orssus just arrived.

orlu asks, "Why isn't that healthy though?"

Sorlu cocks his head at Uniana.

Raatar takes a moment to observe Sorlu.

Speaking to Stormfather, Yardie says, "I don't know if it should be "done away" but allow stories like some to show that change is on the horizon.  In truth, I've felt the change here in Vaalor.  It is a welcoming one, but I like the stories to do just that."

Speaking to Sorlu, Aliashyrah offers, "I think by healthy she means more positive perhaps? Not interactions that could have potential tension? That's just a guess."

Sorlu says, "Unless there is some sort of OOC trolling going on IG that I don't know about. I certainly wouldn't agree with doing that."

Aliashyrah says, "I will say that I personally have had a chance just yesterday for some fun RP with a Vaalorian that I wouldn't have had without this stuff and it was a positive experience on both sides."

Sorlu agrees with Aliashyrah.

Thandiwe says, "Conflict builds ties, bindings players under diversity, but resolution heralds celebration of differences, builds on the bonding of the conflict that has been resolved, and promotes growth.  There will be some bumpy roads ahead, but there always are.  The storylines that are unfolding in early 2023 are.. different and are built on the backs of those things that have come before."

Sorlu agrees with Thandiwe.

Aliashyrah smiles at Alcarinque.

Yardie subtly coughs, "Call the Palestra to help."

Thandiwe says, "The period of resolution should be ample."

Speaking to Thandiwe, Aliashyrah says, "I really like that way of looking at things."

Speaking to Yardie, Mazreth says, "We got this."

Mazreth winks at Yardie.

Yardie winks at Mazreth.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "While these stories are going on, there is also not reason that I cannot make Monday nights more impactful." </span></b>

Teveriel says, "Conflict is fine, and the interactions between players has been great and clearly IC-oriented. But having been around for the GSS, it brought a lot of friction that bled into OOC territory for players who were left confused as to why all of a sudden they were being made to feel more unwelcome than in the past."

Uniana says, "A handful of us came back to EN last year and it was in a very bad place, I would still state a lot of our concerns are there and I am huge fan of conflict. I agree, but to say "this is what we think the solution is to a community that's been pretty much thrown away by a large portion of the game" doesn't sit well with me."

Agathilea smiles at Mazreth.

You've gained 1 physical training point.

Zoelle raises her hand.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Zoelle. </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I like her raising her hand for me." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka glances at Zoelle. </span></b>

Aendir's body pulses momentarily into semi transparency and then returns to normal.

A shadow seems to detach itself from Aendir's body, swiftly dissipating into the air.

Zoelle asks, "I just want to mention that I ran storylines years before that were character building, and an opportunity for fun, and I was ripped apart for it?"

Zoelle says, "Wait... not a question. That's a statement."

Thandiwe says, "For those of you asking, the GSS means Griffin Sword Saga."

Zoelle says, "It was a week long storyline, and people HATED it."

You hear very soft footsteps.

Zoelle hangs her head.

Speaking to Zoelle, Mazreth says, "They were not well received at all."

Speaking to Thandiwe, Krystalena says, "Thank you."

Thandiwe says, "Large portions of the lands were invaded at various intervals and the entire west was invited to - essentially - invade with their own fighting forces."

The moss green sprite flying above Dendum's shoulder sits down on it briefly before returning to the air.

Yardie looks over at Dendum and shakes his head.

Thandiwe says, "Unfortunately, because we are not there yet, I can't make any promises or assurances to you or clarify in what ways Vaalor will have a part in the global storyline."

Zoelle says, "I guess my point is, there is something everyone and not every one likes every kind of story."

Thandiwe says, "What I can say is that it isn't passing."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I am sure we can look at what we can do to Monday Night's to make them more meaningful and impactful, but they will also be used to introduce new things like shops, events, festivals, etc. as I like to do those in game." </span></b>

Zoelle mutters, "Something for*."

Thandiwe says, "And not nearly as intrusive as the GSS."

Teveriel says, "Definitely don't expect you to spill all the beans."

Agathilea adopts an agreeable expression.

Sorlu warmly says, "Obviously it's not my place to comment about how Ta'Vaalor is run. I invest my time in Icemule. But I have loved the interactions between our two towns. I would hope that nobody thinks of this as unhealthy, and would gently suggest that if you seeing anyone who is someone taking an odd OOC offense to this, to remind them that we are all just playing a game where we create stories. And if someone would like to speak with me OOC about it because they are feeling for some reason uncomfortable, than I am also willing to have that talk with them."

Aendir says, "I am optimistic and look forward to participating."

Teveriel nods appreciatively at Sorlu.

Uniana says, "I mean, I am willing to give some good faith and lean into it, but I also want to let know how some of us who have actually been trying to *restore* Vaalor for lack of a better term feel and what our chief concerns are."

Casil nods at Uniana.

Yardie muses, "I...about the resolution at the end...if the conflict leads to the resolution being earned, it's going to be a beautiful thing when it arrives.  But it is going to take people to realize the struggle is part of it."

Zoelle nods understandingly.

Raatar nods appreciatively at Uniana.

Aliashyrah says, "I can only speak for myself, but my goal is always encouragnig and fostering more RP. I like the interaction between east and west. Too often I feel like EN and the west are two different worlds/games."

Sorlu nods at Yardie.

Thandiwe says, "I'm concerned that you feel you have to restore Vaalor.  I've always found her character as a town, players, and environment to be proud, educated, and colorful."

Speaking to Sorlu, Mazreth says, "I have enjoyed our interactions via vignette (sp?) on discord and think you have handled the separation well."

Speaking to Uniana, Tylanthriel says, "What do you feel the state of TV is now as far as restoration? I ask mostly of ignorance as I haven't not been back for too long."

Speaking to Aliashyrah, Teveriel says, "It really does feel that way at times."

Aliashyrah says, "I hope this whole thing will provide plenty of opportunties for more interaction across realms."

Stormfather says, "I hadn't thought about Uniana's concern before....as my actual character is sort of charmed and amused by it. But...there is a sizeable set of voices in the community that continue to delcare the ENs players as toxic. Its not healthy, and I'm not saying its people here now. But I can see a concern about painting a group of players already fighting off OOC accusations with IC political aggression that they didn't ask for."

Speaking to Thandiwe, Casil says, "I think she means in the opinion non-EN players have about it, I think."

Speaking to Mazreth, Sorlu says, "Thank you, and likewise. I love the buzz and energy...and the goal is to invite people into it who wish to."

Krystalena points at Stormfather.

Raatar says, "That nailed it."

Speaking to Thandiwe, Elysani says, "And that opinion is still pretty negative from past experiences with some past players."

Raatar points at Stormfather.

Casil nods at Elysani.

Casil points at Elysani.

Raatar nods in agreement at Elysani.

Stormfather says, "I hate to say...go look at discord...but....voices there routinely 'half-joke' that the En should be deleted."

Elysani says, "It was a lot of RP damage honestly."

Krystalena says, "There's a lot of haters out there."

Stormfather says, "And its only a half joke at best."

Raatar says, "It feelsl like we have just gotten going and now have to address the past once more."

Yardie says, "I think...what you all have been doing so far...will help chase that negative feeling away.  But use RP as that vessel, storytelling as that vessel."

Speaking to Krystalena, Teveriel says, "Haters gonna hate."

Alcarinque says, "There were a small group of players in the past that really left a sour taste in everyone's mouth and sort of colored their opinions of the area as a whole."

Raatar adopts an agreeable expression.

Esana nods at Alcarinque.

Tylanthriel nods.

Teveriel nods at Alcarinque.

Alcarinque says, "I think that's the worry some people have with having another "East vs. West" sort of storyline running."

Uniana says, "Pretty sure when I first came back and asked if OSA would ever come to EN that was very much said "It would be a waste because it wouldn't save Vaalor" - this place can be a ghost town."

ylanthriel says, "I think I understand."

Thandiwe says, "Woah."

Stormfather nods understandingly at Uniana.

Speaking to Alcarinque, Mazreth says, "The majority of those players are no longer around though.  Some by choice, some not so much."

Thandiwe slowly empties her lungs.

Krystalena says, "It's really hard to work with new players when their outside buddies are smacking TV before they ever get here.

Speaking to Mazreth, Casil says, "Doesn't stop the bad memories people have, unfortunately."

Esana nods at Krystalena.

Mazreth agrees with Casil.

Speaking to Mazreth, Alcarinque says, "Exactly, yet there are numerous players in the West that still hold onto their dislike of the Elven Nations."

Speaking to Mazreth, Alcarinque says, "So even though that element has been removed, the stain still remains."

Agathilea says, "When I started, I heard many negative things about the fortress."

Agathilea nods at Krystalena.

Yardie says, "I was told to come here, RP wise, because Yardie's brother was the one that said, "See the truth for yourself".  That was the vehicle that brought me here."

Krystalena says, "I've encountered several who come into TV as a rolled newbie.  First thing they want to do is leave."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "But the positive interactions players have when they meet up with all of you is wonderful." </span></b>

Speaking to Alcarinque, Mazreth asks, "Then how do you change that if they are not willing to come see?"

Agathilea says, "I didn't back off, but I heard them."

Yardie says, "I'm thankful for it, and for some of the conflicts that have come from it."

Speaking to Alcarinque, Sorlu says, "That's RP, if you're speaking of the Icemule stuff."

orlu says, "I personally love the Nations in an OOC way."

Speaking to Sorlu, Stormfather says, "It goes way back. Well before that, honestly."

Sorlu nods at Stormfather.

Speaking to Valyrka, Krystalena says, "Orssus and I have been working on the interactions for a long time."

Mazreth agrees with Stormfather.

Thandiwe says, "That's a lot to take in.  While some faces are still the same, there has been a lot of movement behind the scenes.  Our team structures are different but our goals have shifted and are different, too.  We are slowly coming out of the murky waters of that change, mostly becaucse it was so very shocking of a change for many, and while I don't want to make empty promises, the one thing that I can promise is that every day my team strives to do better."

Speaking to Mazreth, Alcarinque says, "That's above my paygrade, I'm just pointing out that is probably part of the hesitance players in the East feel about confrontational storylines."

Speaking to Stormfather, Sorlu says, "Then I'll quiet my mouth."

Sorlu grins at Stormfather.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I will say." </span></b>

Speaking to Thandiwe, Yardie says, "I appreciate that."

Uniana nods at Thandiwe.

Thandiwe says, "We hear you."

Sorlu applauds Thandiwe.

Thandiwe says, "We are striving to do better."

The misty halo fades from Esana.

Thandiwe says, "Some subtle examples of this can be seen every day..."

Speaking to Alcarinque, Mazreth says, "That makes sense, I hadn't considered the impact an confrontational story might have on it."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I see what you are saying and I take your thoughts to heart about Monday nights, but there is also room for different stories and interactions." </span></b>

Speaking to Thandiwe, Krystalena says, "Osa has helped."

The air about Esana stops shimmering.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "From conflict can some positive things." </span></b>

Alcarinque says, "I'm usually relatively hands-off and stick to my own little corners in this game. But tossing players a bone and having some sort of collaborative storyline vs. confrontational might be a way to foster good will and inclusion."

Alcarinque says, "But then again, I just hide and watch the goings on from the shadows."

The powerful look leaves Orssus.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Please don't, jump in." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Alcarinque. </span></b> <b></b>

Alcarinque says, "Yeah... I like hiding."

Stormfather says, "My friend just quit the game. He said he expected collaborative story telling. After a year of waiting, he gave up."

Stormfather nods in agreement at Alcarinque.

Speaking to Uniana, Valyrka says, "Thank you for your frank words."

Agathilea nods firmly at Uniana.

Krystalena says, "I'd like to see the Grimswarm retalliate after our Friday raiding night.  Doesn't have to be big, but some kind of response from them."

The dim aura fades from around Orssus.

Speaking to Krystalena, Esana says, "They have before, remember? They put out bounties on GoS members. Then ended up taking kakoon."

Alcarinque says, "I think the storyline Mazreth had about the Sylvan child and the magic stick was a good example, on a smaller scale. Illistim was involved because no one in Ta'Vaalor had the skill and ability to deal with the artifact."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "And I also ask that you keep an open mind when stories happen.  But we are listening."</span> </b>

Krystalena nods at Esana.

Uniana says, "I mean without sounding like a jerk, I've put my money where my mouth is. I've given my time, creativity and valuable items in and out of game to do essentially a refresh to get people to come here. I've made the TV Rp Discord which I think is a huge success, but I will say player stuff only goes so far IMO. Some people will only show up when that's reflected on the GM side."

Speaking to Esana, Mazreth says, "I did that!  Reverse bounties were fun."

Esana nods at Mazreth.

Agathilea stares at Mazreth.

Speaking to Mazreth, Esana says, "It was great."

Speaking to Mazreth, Krystalena asks, "Didn't you do the little kobold that got into the fortress?"

Agathilea mutters, "He is only out to kill us."

Yardie snickers at Agathilea.

Mazreth looks over at Krystalena and shakes his head.

Speaking to Agathilea, Zoelle says, "Not just him."

Mazreth winks at Agathilea.

Speaking to Agathilea, Alcarinque says, "Not totally... just mostly."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Thank you for the discussion about stories, Monday nights, and interactions. I do appreciate the feedback." </span></b>

Agathilea blinks at Zoelle.

Agathilea whines at Zoelle!

Stormfather says, "I'd also just say that alot of players, when prompted by Wyrom a few months ago, were asked to give feedback on what sort of RP we would like. We never heard anything about those email, who saw them, if they were read, etc. Not that they are specific to EN, but with the whole bunch of you GMs focused on this stuff here, I'm hoping those emails got sent around to the appropriate people."

Speaking to Valyrka, Yardie says, "I do like the new characters.  It does seem like there's more coming and expanding.  And they've been interesting folks."

Zoelle whispers outloud to Agathilea, "KEEEEEEEL YOU!!!!"

Speaking to Yardie, Valyrka says, "Thanks, we havd had fun with them."

Agathilea inhales to speak, only to pause and measure her words while contemplating her thigh-sheath with narrowed eyes.

Uniana says, "Also, this side conversation feels pretty disrespectful."

Agathilea glances at Zoelle.

Speaking to Valyrka, Krystalena says, "One of the GMs had a little kobold sneak into the fortress once and was telling us how the bigger kobold were picking on it.  Those little random events are fun."

Speaking to Uniana, Yardie says, "Not my intention."

Thandiwe says, "Trust me when I say that I read a lot of email in a week and while I can't always respond to it, it doesn't mean I'm not endeavouring to enact change."

Stormfather nods.

Teveriel nods at Thandiwe.

Agathilea grins at Alcarinque.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Krystalena. </span></b> <b></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "That is fun." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka grins at Krystalena. </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Someone else had their hand up and now I lost it." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka gazes in wonder at her surroundings. </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Stormfather. </span></b>

Stormfather asks, "Only if Uniana is done?"

Stormfather glances at Uniana.

Esana nods.

Uniana appreciatively says, "I am, thanks."

Uniana hugs Stormfather.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I took the silence to be that, but I am sorry if I stepped in early." </span></b>

Agathilea says, "Me too."

Stormfather says, "I can never tell with typing delays."

Agathilea nods at Uniana.

Stormfather smiles at Uniana.

Stormfather says, "So mine is about the Monday night feedback."

Stormfather says, "I think in general I'd like to see some sense of continuity from one week to the next, along with a stronger sense of purpose to RP nights."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Sure." </span></b>

Stormfather says, "I'm not looking for anything world shattering, but I'd love if say some Vaalorian weaponsmith needed our help with 3 or 4 tasks (say like one per week) and at the end, player success or failure of helping the weaponsmith might have some sort of effect on the town/city that is noticeable. Maybe he's working on a new set of approved nouns for a type of weapon, and if we help him, more of them get approved. And if we don't, they don't. Something like that. Anything where players can impact the world around them in ways you can point to."

Krystalena says, "I apologize."

Casil nods at Stormfather.

Stormfather says, "RP that is purpose and goal driven, gives players soemthing to do, talk about and act on in the week interim to that and then return with results the next week."

Speaking to Stormfather, Valyrka says, "I agree that we can do things like that."

Aendir says, "Cool way to release new updates."

Stormfather says, "I guess I sort of see it like this....some other towns are getting massive hunting ground updates and so on."

Stormfather says, "Why can't EN be the place where RP is born."

Uniana nods firmly at Stormfather.

The powerful look leaves Tylanthriel.

Speaking to Stormfather, Aphaedra says, "That was a terrific idea."

Stormfather says, "Broken clocks."

Speaking to Stormfather, Valyrka says, "Thank you."

Teveriel mutters something about greatmaces.

Mazreth asks, "I see a lot of good RP already.  What am I missing?"

Jaderain nods.

Mazreth says, "Honest question."

Stormfather asks, "Oh...and just a sidebar on the citizenship titles. I don't know if tonight is for all EN stuff...but can we get some movement on half elf citizenship in Illistim?"

Stormfather nods at Mazreth.

Alcarinque mutters mudbloods.

(Aphaedra high fives Stormfather.)

Alcarinque appears to be trying hard not to grin.

Agathilea gawks at Alcarinque.

Speaking to Mazreth, Stormfather says, "So...."

Aendir says, "I think it makes sense in a place like Illistim, of all places."

Speaking to Mazreth, Stormfather says, "I'll take one of the characters we had recently."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Tonight is about Ta'vaalaor." </span></b>

Stormfather says, "Gasen. Gasen is a pretty fun character NPC honestly."

Stormfather says, "He's snarky, has a thing for the ladies....etc."

Agathilea beams!

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "He is my fav." </span></b>

Stormfather says, "I really enjoy him."

Agathilea agrees with Valyrka.

Stormfather says, "But...he's just....there. Pops in. Pops out."

Alcarinque snaps his fingers.

Alcarinque raises his hand.

Stormfather asks, "But...you've got an aspiring warrior there....what could players do in the weeks between mondays to help him become the man he wants to be?"

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "He is training and growing." </span></b>

Stormfather says, "Give players Roleplaying assignments of sorts."

Stormfather asks, "Right...but help players help him grow?"

Speaking to Stormfather, Mazreth asks, "So is it continuity and consistency you're looking for?"

Stormfather says, "Impact."

Stormfather says, "I want what he does...."

Stormfather points at Teveriel.

Stormfather says, "To matter here."

Stormfather points down.

Stormfather says, "And everyone else."

ynwen asks, "So like measurable goals -- like "go find some things or research things and bring back next week to help him" --- that sort of thing?"

Speaking to Stormfather, Mazreth says, "Thanks, that's actually helpful and answers what I was looking for."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I agree things can be better and appreciate your thoughts." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I would not have asked if I did not care." </span></b>

Speaking to Stormfather, Mazreth asks, "Can I ask one other thing?"

Uniana says, "I'm also going to add like just understanding there's more to this place than the Legion - no offense, it's one of the coolest things you can do in this whole game because it has full lore and measurable goals and a way to progress."

Stormfather says, "Sure...i'm not hourly."

Agathilea agrees with Uniana.

Speaking to Stormfather, Mazreth asks, "Would you be okay with that impact going either way.  Negatively if it was warranted by the RP?"

Speaking to Uniana, Teveriel says, "I was actually going to bring that up myself. But yes, well said."

Speaking to Uniana, Zoelle says, "I agree, but disagree."

Speaking to Uniana, Zoelle says, "The entire society is based on a military structure."

Speaking to Mazreth, Stormfather says, "So I've been asked that before by other players who I respect....I have a firm personal answer."

Speaking to Mazreth, Alcarinque asks, "Like putting a huge crater in the middle of town if we don't divert the magical meteor in time?"

Zoelle says, "You can't speak to the King without speaking to the Commander of legions."

Uniana says, "I want more lore like the Vaalor customs document, which Tev's player and I used religious for our character's wedding and leading up to it. Things that people can like lean into instead of just making up everything. When the coast opened there should have information about why the strongest military entity in the world never had a navy and didn't see the coastline as a strategic advantage."

Stormfather says, "Yes......depending on the scope of the negativity that personally hits the player."

Thandiwe says, "Yes, but I think her point is that there are whole communities of people that rise up around those military structure to support and nurture those impacted by their duty."

Speaking to Mazreth, Stormfather says, "If my character suffers? sure. If I the player suffer? No."

Zoelle nods at Thandiwe.

Teveriel nods in agreement at Thandiwe.

Speaking to Thandiwe, Zoelle says, "That's why I agree but also disagree."

Aendir says, "I think those of us who have played Elves for a long time are tired of House tropes and would like to see some unique flavor."

Speaking to Stormfather, Alcarinque says, "That's actually a very concise way to put it."

Stormfather says, "So like...you sink my fleet and destroy my sword and I'm out a ton of money and time? No. You banish me? Sure."

Aendir says, "Vaalor is militaristic, but that's not all it is."

Speaking to Aendir, Elysani says, "Mini-house tropes."

Elysani pinches herself hard.

Jaderain agrees with Aendir.

Uniana asks, "Yeah - is Ta'Vaalor the bread bowl of the city-states, we have all these farms, what kind of innovations does it take to feed the most populous of the elven houses?"

Teveriel says, "I'll just throw out where my own character's interests lie, and that's in Vaalor politics. Prior to (re)joining at the formation of the Hawks, he had already served his century of service and was to be a diplomat."

Alcarinque asks, "Can we have a pit installed to kick offensive dipolmats into?"

Speaking to Stormfather, Mazreth says, "It would never be anything like that, more say, you don't do what's needed to help Gasen train and he quits and is never seen again."

Speaking to Mazreth, Stormfather asks, "Of course....why wouldn't i be okay with that?"

Stormfather says, "Let him get strung up by Grimswarm and eaten."

Speaking to Alcarinque, Teveriel roars, "THIS. IS. TA'VAALOR!"

Stormfather says, "Guess we should have done a better job teaching him to soldier."

Speaking to Stormfather, Mazreth says, "Not everyone is, just making sure we're on the same page."

Stormfather says, "Should have gone Kroderine Soul."

Alcarinque points at Teveriel.

Stormfather says, "Sucker."

Uniana groans at Stormfather.

Yardie says, "That would require time and investment."

Agathilea agrees with Teveriel.

Agathilea appears to be trying hard not to grin.

Speaking to Mazreth, Tylanthriel says, "I like all of that."

Yardie says, "Like, getting the numbers and the people to be here to help him."

Yardie says, "I'm down for that."

Mazreth raises his hand.

Agathilea turns an inquisitive ear toward Mazreth.

Uniana says, "Also I don't want us to ignore that Esana had her hand raised as well."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "So while we are on topic we have verged into several branches." </span></b>

Stormfather says, "Oh, I'm all done fyi. I actually would defer to the people who are here every day."

Stormfather nods at Esana.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Esana. </span></b>

Agathilea smiles at Esana.

Aphaedra smiles at Esana.

Esana asks, "Mine was a simple question, FoTF next year?"

Alcarinque lets out a cheer!

Teveriel grins at Esana.

Agathilea applauds Esana.

Krystalena exclaims, "We love FotF!"

Agathilea roars!

Aphaedra says, "I think I missed what that was."

Aphaedra says, "I haven't been here a full year."

Agathilea grins at Krystalena.

Krystalena says, "Festival of the Fallen."

Speaking to Aphaedra, Teveriel says, "An event centered around a melee to honor those who fell in battle, basically."

Aphaedra says, "Ahhh."

Aphaedra says, "Cool."

Speaking to Aphaedra, Agathilea says, "I was barely able to walk, but I was out in an arena taking on a foe."

Agathilea grins at Aphaedra.

Speaking to Aphaedra, Krystalena says, "It's where the verdant path at the end of Neartofar road goes."

Speaking to Agathilea, Yardie says, "It was fun."

Aphaedra grins at Agathilea.

Agathilea grins at Yardie.

Speaking to Krystalena, Aphaedra says, "Ooooooooooh."

Speaking to Aphaedra, Teveriel says, "People enter, get pwned by Yakushi, and have merchant work and stuff."

Speaking to Krystalena, Aphaedra exclaims, "I always wondered about that!"

Speaking to Teveriel, Alcarinque says, "Hey, I didn't get pwned."

Speaking to Yardie, Agathilea says, "Was exciting, got beat up, then learned to dance."

Agathilea flashes a wide grin.

Yardie winks at Agathilea.

Speaking to Teveriel, Alcarinque says, "It took him 4 casts."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "We are still planning on things, so I cannot confirm at this time." </span></b>

Speaking to Aphaedra, Krystalena says, "Really neat statues and flowers out there."

Teveriel grins at Alcarinque.

Esana says, "Also just a small comment."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "When it comes back believe me, you will know." </span></b>

Aendir waves to Dendum.

Agathilea hugs Dendum.

Dendum waves.

Raatar folds his wings across his back.

Esana says, "One of the things I loved would be standing in King's Court never knowing if the guard was listening in.  The random small interactions go a long way to making the town feel alive.  Oh and small storyline that are maybe a week long. Nothing major just something to participate in."

Sorlu smiles at Dendum.

Krystalena agrees with Esana.

Esana says, "And finished."

Speaking to Esana, Mazreth says, "The guard is listening... always."

Agathilea smirks at Mazreth.

Stormfather says, "I gotta run. Thanks for taking my question and listening to the good folks who want TV to shine."

Agathilea says, "Gonna test it."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Always." </span></b>

Wylloh agrees with Mazreth.

Speaking to Mazreth, Esana says, "Yeah, but it's been a long time since they interacted."

Speaking to Mazreth, Aphaedra says, "I am starting to feel bad for the guard."

Stormfather stands up.

Stormfather just went through a small rose-covered arch.

Teveriel says, "Thanks for--"

Teveriel glances at a small rose-covered arch.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka turns to face Sorlu. </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "You had a question." </span></b>

Teveriel says, "He really had to go."

Agathilea glances at a small rose-covered arch.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Sorlu. </span></b>

Agathilea nods at Teveriel.

Aphaedra grins at Teveriel.

Uniana says, "Kids prob."

Speaking to Valyrka, Sorlu asks, "I did?"

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra asks, "Maybe I imagined it?" </span></b>

Casil asks, "Do you mind if I make a comment on Esana's statement before Sorlu speaks?"

ylanthriel says, "I wonder if his kids call him lightning daddy too."

Tylanthriel ponders.

Speaking to Valyrka, Sorlu says, "I don't have one at the moment. Just listening in."

Sorlu grins at Valyrka.

Aphaedra laughs at Tylanthriel!

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Casil. </span></b>

Casil nods.

Alcarinque glances at Valyrka and raises his hand.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka grins at Alcarinque. </span></b>

Jaderain traces a series of glowing runes while chanting an arcane phrase...

Jaderain gestures.

Jaderain suddenly disappears.

Alcarinque says, "If all of the important inquiries have been made:"

Alcarinque clears his throat.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "One moment." </span></b>

Casil says, "So, I do and have actually popped in fairly frequently, but I do find people are uh, daydreaming a lot."

Casil chuckles.

Alcarinque nods.

Alcarinque rocks back on his heels.

Esana flaps her white-feathered wings, causing a light breeze throughout the area.

Casil says, "What does help, just as a reminder, and I think I said this in Discord, is to RP NOMINATE when y'all are doing things so we know people are awake and active.  It catches my attention even if I'm working on things."

Agathilea nods slowly.

Teveriel nods at Casil.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka agrees with Casil. </span></b>

Sorlu nods at Casil.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "It really does." </span></b>

Esana nods at Casil.

Aphaedra nods at Casil.

Thandiwe says, "It catches a lot of our attention."

Wylloh adopts an agreeable expression.

Aphaedra says, "I am so bad at remembering to do that."

Casil nods at Thandiwe.

Casil says, "I didn't mean to just say mine."

Krystalena agrees with Aphaedra.

Speaking to Aphaedra, Teveriel says, "I am, too."

Aliashyrah nods in agreement.

Thandiwe tickles Casil as they grin at each other.

Aliashyrah says, "A great reminder. I've been working on using it more."

Speaking to Aphaedra, Yardie says, "I've noticed it does work often when I do it.  And I try to get y'all your flowers when you're killing it."

orlu says, "I'm guilty of not doing that enough myself. I need to be better at it. Or not thinking of it until near the end of the amazing RP."

Thandiwe says, "I know, just emphasising its usefulness as it is a good suggestion."

Sorlu frowns.

Casil says, "But I have it in VERY BRIGHT RED HIGHLIGHT so I can't miss it, and I have and do show up if I'm free and people are out and about in TV."

Aliashyrah says, "And each time i've used it, I saw RPAs go out or saw some indication that a GM obviously came and started watching."

Agathilea flashes a wide grin at Casil.

Teveriel nods appreciatively at Casil.

Casil says, "So use it liberally."

Casil grins.

Sorlu nods at Aliashyrah.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I have it highlighted as well." </span></b>

Agathilea nods once at Valyrka.

Teveriel says, "I do everything liberally."

Teveriel raises his fist defiantly.

Aliashyrah flashes a quick grin at Teveriel.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka grins at Teveriel. </span></b>

Casil nods at Valyrka.

Sorlu grins at Teveriel.

Thandiwe says, "I have a sound I need to change because it scares the poo out of me every time."

Aliashyrah begins chuckling at Thandiwe!

Sorlu snickers at Thandiwe.

Krystalena giggles.

Teveriel begins chuckling at Thandiwe!

Speaking to Thandiwe, Casil says, "That's madness."

Agathilea begins chuckling at Thandiwe!

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka turns to face Alcarinque. </span></b>

Alcarinque nods once.

Agathilea turns an inquisitive ear toward Alcarinque.

Yardie snickers at Dendum.

Uniana nods at Mazreth.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "The floor is yours." </span></b>

Thandiwe says, "I have so many sounds for specific things that I sometimes forget what tey are for and where they are coming from."

Alcarinque asks, "So a while ago I was warned that my storms of pastries could break the game instance. Have there been any recent hardware updates that would allow me to increase the numbers?"

Alcarinque flashes a wide grin.

Tivvy grins at Thandiwe.

Teveriel expounds lyrically upon the shortcomings of Alcarinque.

Alcarinque says, "100 honey buns just isn't enough."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Not that I know of, and please don't." </span></b>

Thandiwe asks, "Storms of Pastries?"

Alcarinque sighs heavily.

Aphaedra grins at Alcarinque.

Speaking to Thandiwe, Orssus says, "I have a muffled cough sound effect when I get pointed at during a merchant."

Thandiwe begins chuckling at Orssus!

Speaking to Thandiwe, Alcarinque says, "Years ago I used to blow around 200 food items using 612."

Thandiwe gets a blank look on her face.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I got told about dropping 10000 lobsters in the middle of landing once because I could crash things." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Just... don't." </span></b>

Krystalena says, "Anarquendi does that."

Speaking to Krystalena, Alcarinque says, "Yeah, that's me."

Orssus chuckles.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "But honeybuns are welcome in moderation." </span></b>

Alcarinque says, "Anarquendi and Aharil are in Icemule, I forgot to run them back here while I was making dinner."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Everything in moderation." </span></b>

Speaking to Valyrka, Alcarinque asks, "So like... 200? 250?"

Speaking to Valyrka, Alcarinque says, "Backpacks hold 200."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka stares at Alcarinque. </span></b>

Thandiwe says, "Uhm, dirty honeybuns sound kind of oooookey."

Teveriel says, "Anarquendi's special brand of pastry-based anarchy."

Agathilea flashes a wide grin at Alcarinque.

Speaking to Alcarinque, Valyrka asks, "Anything else?"

Alcarinque says, "I once did 2 backpacks and nothing broke that time."

Alcarinque sighs.

Alcarinque looks over at Valyrka and shakes his head.

Alcarinque says, "No."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka turns to face Uniana. </span></b>

Speaking to Alcarinque, Krystalena says, "Nice to meet the paladin."

Alcarinque sticks out his tongue.

Agathilea nods in agreement.

Alcarinque grins at Krystalena.

Speaking to Alcarinque, Agathilea says, "Yes, indeed."

Speaking to Uniana, <b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Please."</span></b>

Swirls of gold, forest green, and dark jacinthe light momentarily surround Yardie's ghezyte bracelet.

Uniana says, "I just want to say on the topic of calling out people for doing good, we should all throw a bone to Torbot. The game really jerked EN around with the invoker being solo Landing and he still shows up and provides support and that once again should be acknowledged with gratitude."

Teveriel applauds.

Mazreth agrees with Uniana.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "He is a great person and I know he loves helping." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "And I know players appreciate it." </span></b>

Aphaedra says, "Truth."

Aendir says, "Agreed. Would be cool if there was some IC acknowledgement of how he helps adventurers in Vaalor."

Casil says, "Torbot is wonderful for doing that."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I would be cool if there was." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka glances at Mazreth. </span></b>

Krystalena says, "He tolerates us being late on Thursdays as well."

Teveriel glances at Mazreth.

Agathilea stares at Mazreth, tapping her foot impatiently as she waits.

Alcarinque asks, "Can we have a Torbot statue?"

Alcarinque begs.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Thanks for bringing that up." </span></b>

Aphaedra asks, "Right at the court. Maybe on a bench?"

Speaking to Valyrka, Mazreth says, "We can discuss something."

Uniana says, "A nice bench in a fishing spot maybe."

Alcarinque says, "I tried to cast spells every night for a couple months and it was brutal."

Aphaedra agrees with Uniana.

Teveriel says, "That moment when the whole class turns and stares at you."

Alcarinque says, "I don't know how he did it multiple times a day."

Agathilea says, "Yes, he is into fishing and it would be fitting."

Mazreth says, "Ta'Vaalor does have non-military awards."

Krystalena says, "And Torbot doesn't use a script."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Mazreth. </span></b>

Agathilea agrees with Alcarinque.

Teveriel nods at Mazreth.

Agathilea agrees with Krystalena.

Orssus says, "Yeah, that's the crazy cherry on top."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I have a question now." </span></b>

Orssus says, "He does it all through his three acounts, by hand."

Uniana nods at Valyrka.

Krystalena adopts an agreeable expression.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Or first a statement." </span></b>

Orssus says, "I imagine he doesn't have multiple monitors either."

Krystalena says, "And he's in his 70s."

Teveriel says, "He's a manual man."

Lord Alcarinque just went through a small rose-covered arch.

Orssus says, "Probably doing it on a del XP laptop or something crazy."

Aliashyrah asks, "Is there a reason why the EN can't have an invoker type character?"

Aliashyrah says, "I always thought it was strange that it was only in WL."

Lord Alcarinque just arrived.

Alcarinque takes a bite of his honey-covered bun.

Aliashyrah says, "But I'm newer so maybe there is a reason."

Speaking to Aliashyrah, Teveriel says, "We would be too OP."

Deep blue motes swirl away from Tylanthriel and fade.

The deep blue glow leaves Tylanthriel.

You hear a "Woosh!" of breath.

Speaking to Teveriel, Aliashyrah says, "Ah, that explains everything. It's your handicap."

Aliashyrah nods understandingly at Teveriel.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "While it is not always comfortable, I appreciate your words." </span></b>

Uniana grins.

Teveriel nods gravely.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "All of them." </span></b>

Uniana nods gratefully at Valyrka.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "We can always do better, and goddess knows I can as well." </span></b>

Aendir says, "Not me."

Aendir says, "Reached full potential."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka starts chortling. </span></b>

Orssus says, "I was waiting for someone to say it."

Aendir says, "All downward from here."

Teveriel says, "This isn't even my final form."

You hear someone laugh.

Alcarinque says, "Yeah, you all show surprising restraint. I'd be tyrannical."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "So thank you for them, as you see we have many gm's who care and it takes a gaggle of them to do great things." </span></b>

Agathilea nods enthusiastically!

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Gaggle of gms." </span></b>

Orssus asks, "Oh wait...did anyone bring up the papers system yet?"

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "New phrase." </span></b>

Orssus glances around the room.

Agathilea says, "Better than geese."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka stares at Orssus. </span></b>

Xynwen says, "An Apocalypse of GMs."

Uniana begins chortling at Orssus.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "They all burned." </span></b>

Orssus appears to be trying hard not to grin.

Aendir says, "I think they're called a murder."

Agathilea says, "Ooh."

Agathilea grins at Xynwen.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "All the papers." </span></b>

Teveriel appears to be struggling to keep a straight face as he glances at Orssus.

Casil works his fingers under his red Santa hat and scratches his head.

Speaking to Valyrka, Aliashyrah says, "Did you see my question about the invoker? I'm just super curious about it."

Mazreth looks at Orssus blankly, at a loss to express himself.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "The invoker is not coming to the nations." </span></b>

Speaking to Aliashyrah, Uniana explains, "Dev said no. They "claim" they are going to remove it soon from the landing."

Dendum snaps his fingers.

Speaking to Mazreth, Krystalena says, "Admit you knew that question was missing."

Speaking to Uniana, Aliashyrah says, "Oh okay."

Aliashyrah says, "Thanks. I was just curious."

Aliashyrah says, "Not trying to cause waves."

Agathilea smiles at Uniana.

Mazreth agrees with Krystalena.

Aliashyrah smiles at Uniana.

Alcarinque takes a bite of his cinnamon bun.

Speaking to Krystalena, Mazreth says, "Now the evening feels complete."

Aliashyrah smiles at Valyrka.

Uniana says, "No, it's nonsense."

(Teveriel makes air quotes.)

Aendir says, "I know at least a few people who have the same mentality as myself, that the invoker's been pretty damaging to interaction in the game."

Uniana says, "Either make it available for everyone or no one."

Suddenly, you notice Alcarinque floating several feet above the ground!  After several seconds, he settles back to the ground, right where he left it.

Uniana bitterly says, "Just like omnishrines."

Agathilea stares at Alcarinque.

Uniana turns to face Valyrka.

Alcarinque says, "I forgot about that..."

Aendir says, "Either through taking away players from other areas, or replacing that exchange of spells between players."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "I think that is the eventual idea, but I am not dev and will not speak or pretend to be knowledgable." </span></b>

Uniana nods in agreement at Aendir.

Aendir says, "Used to be a market for the latter."

Aliashyrah nods.

Teveriel nods understandingly at Valyrka.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "But the community has stepped up and helped each other." </span></b>

Aliashyrah says, "It was just a question I've had since finding out about the invoker. I do like players doing spell ups in town center."

Orssus says, "The Invoker does seem like something I would have never expected to exist."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "So kudos to you all." </span></b>

Yardie nods in agreement at Valyrka.

Aliashyrah says, "We did that in Icemule for a new player the other nigth and it was fun to see all the team work of everyone coming together to make her shiny."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Now for my question." </span></b>

Teveriel nods in agreement at Aliashyrah.

Speaking to Aliashyrah, Uniana says, "Yeah we have a spellups channel in our TV discord."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "In the lines of always learning and doing better." </span></b>

Teveriel turns an inquisitive ear toward Valyrka.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Are there other things, not the invoker, we can update, look into, add etc." </span></b>

Aliashyrah says, "That is one thing I'm taking away from this meeting, and thanks for letting me come listen and talk a little, is that you all seem to have a really great group of people working to build a good community."

Aliashyrah says, "It's been fun to listen and hear about all that is going on here."

&gt;l head

You see nothing unusual.

&gt;l body

You see Hycinthia.  Her slender body lays draped over the block, blood spurting from her neck.

Speaking to Aliashyrah, <b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka says, "Thanks we have a great group of players and GM'swho are passionate."</span></b>

Uniana says, "I will say I've noticed a lot of the new ambients and they are lovely."

A faint silver nimbus appears surrounding Esana for a few moments before silently winking out.

Krystalena asks, "Can we make the shop keepers not as snotty to non-elves?"

Speaking to Uniana, Valyrka says, "Thank you."

Mazreth agrees with Valyrka.

Aphaedra grins at Krystalena.

Alcarinque points at Esana.

Esana says, "I'd love to see the bakery updated. I know it's a weird thing to ask for, but it'd be nice to have a different selection of baked goods from that shop."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra nods at Esana. </span></b>

Esana says, "They're so... bleh."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "So noted." </span></b>

Alcarinque says, "This cinnamon bun tastes like the honey bun."

The deep blue glow leaves Krystalena.

The light blue glow leaves Krystalena.

The powerful look leaves Yardie.

The dully illuminated mantle protecting Yardie begins to falter, then completely fades away.

Yardie begins to breathe less deeply.

The dim aura fades from around Yardie.

he voice of Jaderain huskily says, "The new ambients are wonderful."

Teveriel asks, "But do the snozzberries taste like snozzberries?"

Aendir says, "I'm not sure what the specific answer is, but I think anything that encourages players to congregate and play/roleplay in the same area would be a positive here. We see a lot of people (myself included) kind of just playing in their own little area of the game."

Elysani makes a rude suggestion to Teveriel and gets a firm punch for it.

Sorlu snickers at Teveriel.

Speaking to Teveriel, Wylloh says, "Yes."

You hear someone cackle.

Teveriel says, "Haha, I brought Elysani out of hiding."

Aendir says, "Something to think on a bit more for myself, what would encourage people to congregate? Because that kind of spontaneity if what I feel is missing from the game for me."

Speaking to Valyrka, Yardie says, "I like the slow, tentative opening up of matters.  Whether it's the king or whoever.  There's still a ways to go, but I am hoping that the changes will slowly spread word to other people and cause people to give the place another shot, but it'll take time and work through RP and the like."

Speaking to Valyrka, Alcarinque says, "Oh, I just thought of another quick question, it's related to one of Esana's."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "One second let me catch up." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Thank you for noticing new ambiants." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valyrka nods at Aendir. </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "Something to add to the thought process." </span></b>

Teveriel mutters something about warningshot.

Speaking to Valyrka, Alcarinque asks, "Going off of what Esana brought up earlier: will the spell restrictions for the Tournament during Festival of the Fallen be revisted?"

Yardie glances at Teveriel.

Speaking to Yardie, Thandiwe says, "He was joking."

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "When it happens again, we can look over them." </span></b>

Alcarinque asks, "IE allowing 1030 but banning 635, still banning 720, or still allowing 916 even though squres have no way to deal with it?"

Alcarinque nods at Valyrka.

Thandiwe tickles Yardie.

Speaking to Alcarinque, Casil says, "HIlarious."

Alcarinque says, "But 950 is a crazy spell."

Orssus asks, "That soul ward?"

Alcarinque says, "Core tap."

Xynwen says, "For the fighting pit stuff, it's not specific to FotF, since it is used for the flotilla and other fighting pits."

Agathilea flashes a wide grin at Uniana.

The air about Aliashyrah stops shimmering.

The light blue glow leaves Aliashyrah.

Aliashyrah becomes solid again.

Aliashyrah seems to lose some dexterity.

Aliashyrah takes a deep breath, blinking a couple of times before resuming a calm expression.

Orssus asks, "Was the tangleweed bug fixed?"

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra asks, "Ok to summarize?" </span></b>

Orssus says, "The one that froze people in place."

Alcarinque looks over at Orssus and shakes his head.

Xynwen says, "It started as a Helden Hall thing, and it got expanded, and Kynlee made some awesome updates at some point to make them more expandable."

Aendir's bow is graceful, if perfunctory.  He follows the bow with a brief nod of his head.

Xynwen nods at Mazreth.

Raatar flutters his wings happily, bouncing in place.

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "So it will be a mixture, but I agree with what you are saying, which is why I asked." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "And if I did not want to hear how you felt about things, I would not have asked." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "So there we go." </span></b>

<b><span style="color:#853c41;">Valykra says, "If you think of other things that need updated, please let me know, gs4-Valyrka@play.net." </span></b>
