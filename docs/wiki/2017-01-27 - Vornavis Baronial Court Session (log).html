On a low dais, spanning the southern end of the hall, three regal chairs of state rest before an embroidered tapestry of the Rising Swan of Vornavis that covers the wall behind them.  Banners bearing the coats-of-arms of knights in service to the barony hang from the railing of the second floor gallery that lines the other three sides of the Great Hall.  Opposite the dais a pair of large fel doors, inlaid with gold scrolling, are set in the north wall.  You also see the Ariandae disk, the Faray disk, the Roelaren disk, the Mystiq disk, the brown Salwarry disk, an aged chamberlain and a small side door.
Also here: Commander Roblar, Katiesa, Mohrgan, Ariandae, Great Lord Khazaann, High Lady Augierose, Goldstr, Great Lady Andalusain, Barzillia, High Lady Roelaren, Sir Balantine, Relic Hunter Ordim, Faray, Relic Hunter Legaci, Avalera, Lady Maags, Zuggy, Dame Deavon, Shinann, Sir Cryheart, Grand Lady Mystiq, Cordaleigh, Kayse, Rowmi, Mistress Naamit, Ysharra, Ketarra, Sir Mynon, Fionola, Tarali, Magister Raelee, Dirra, Arrec, Salwarry, Sir Bristenn
Obvious exits: out

An aged chamberlain says, "Please give your attention for Lord Salnim Malwind of Vornavis."

An aged chamberlain says, "And for Lady Athalia Malwind of Vornavis."

Salnim says, "It is always wonderful to have our knighted friends here with us tonight.  I know that especially goes for my sister."

Salnim smiles at Athalia.

Cryheart says, "And ye look more lovely everytime I see ye m'lady."

Athalia gives a sidelong glance at Salnim.

Cryheart smiles at Athalia.

Athalia grins at Cryheart.

Speaking to Cryheart, Athalia says, "Always so dashingly handsome."

Cryheart bows.

Salnim extends a hand to Athalia.

Salnim says, "Before we move on to our first official piece of business."

Salnim says, "I wished to announce that our father reached Lolle safely and without incident."

Salnim says, "He wished to convey that Earl Jovery, the Northern Sentinel, is in good spirits and health."

An aged chamberlain says, "The business of the Court tonight will pertain to the relief effort."

An aged chamberlain says, "As our honored guests are not yet here to join us, we will move to the next guest to stand before the court."

An aged chamberlain says, "Sirs Bristenn Mires and Mynon Felcroth are called before the Court of Vornavis."

Salnim says, "I wished for a formal presentation of the information here tonight."

Bristenn respectfully replies, "We are honored to be before your lordship and her ladyship, though the topic brought to the court is more unfortunate than glad in terms of tidings."

(Dirra carefully steps closer to Bristenn, posture strict.)

Bristenn clearly begins, "Some days ago, Sir Mynon Felcroth and I were on patrol amongst the old ruins, but a jaunt from the outlands.  There we were beset and taken out into the wilderness."

Cryheart turns an inquisitive ear toward Bristenn.

Bristenn slowly confesses, "Realizing our captors and knowing that in armed combat, we would have the best of them, we did not resist, in order to glean this information."

Bristenn adds, "A man calling himself Mureyk, clad in an old cloak of colors we believe were once the Jantalarian livery, is the man behind the warband attempting to force the relief effort out of the northlands."

Athalia raises an eyebrow.

Gurbah frowns to himself.

Bristenn simply states, "We offered parley, but he would not have it- this was the first of his refusals, his second taking place last evening in the wilderness, amongst the snowfall."

Bristenn clearly continues, "His threats were commonplace, including the harm of those we know and care about, though she showed some great reluctance to actually attempt any 
Speaking to Bristenn, Salnim asks, "This second confrontation you spoke of, was this concerning the missing wagon I received a report about?"

Bristenn nods in agreement.

Bristenn clearly answers, "Aye, my lord."

Bristenn neutrally explains, "Last evening, the mercantyler Master Duvernith awaited a wagon returning from Lady Chandrennin's supply hub.  It did not, and we spied fire in the distance."

Salnim says, "I would request a recounting of this incident, if you would.  The report I received was brief."

Athalia shifts her position in the chair to lean forward with a look of concern.

Salnim nods at Bristenn.

Bristenn nods in agreement.

Bristenn slowly continues, "We gave chase, and we lead far afield- we did not find this missing wagon nor her drivers, but Mureyk again and his men."

Gurbah continues to frown, a look of concentration on his face.

Bristenn notes, "The same threats were bandied, though our same offer of parley and peaceful resolution were bandied as well."

Bristenn slowly offers, ".. if it pleases the court, my lord, my lady, may our hospitaller, Dirra Crawfinn, speak of what she learned of the man?"

Dirra turns to face Salnim.

Bristenn nods gravely at Salnim.

Bristenn cocks his head at Dirra.

Bristenn nods slightly at Dirra.

Bristenn folds his hands behind his back.

Speaking to Salnim, Dirra says, "I had opportunity to sense him."

Salnim looks thoughtfully at Dirra.

Dirra says, "His contempt is great."

Athalia leans over and whispers something short to Salnim, the look of concern growing upon her face.

Athalia whispers something to Salnim.

Dirra says, "His anger greater."

Dirra says, "And his desire to punish the 'Swan' greatest."

Speaking to Dirra, Salnim asks, "Sense him in what fashion, Miss Crawfinn?  You were able to read his mind?  His emotions?"

Dirra glances at Bristenn.

Bristenn leans back.

Dinaden glances between Bristenn and Dirra.

Bristenn nods in agreement at Dirra.

Salnim says, "I welcome any information and evidence concerning this man and these incidents."

Speaking to Salnim, Dirra says, "I have a gift of empathy, I sense emotions.  Read truths."

Salnim nods at Dirra.

Dirra says, "I read those."

Dirra sinks into a deep curtsy.

Roelaren smiles at Dirra.

Bristenn slowly agrees, "His words revealed just as much as well, my lord."

Cryheart smiles at Athalia.

Cryheart nods.

Speaking to Salnim, Dirra says, "I am worried."

Dirra says, "All I can add."

Salwarry glances between Cryheart and Athalia.

Mynon adds, "I would note that Mureyk mentioned 'Swans' several times, over both encounters, and his feeling that Vornavis has interfered in other regions of the North is quite clear: It is the most consistent of his themes."

Athalia smiles shyly at Cryheart, a slight flush rising to her cheeks.

Cryheart smiles at Athalia.

Salnim frowns.

Bristenn agrees, "He blames us- not just the knights of your house, but Vornavis, and the other northern provinces, for the destruction of Talador and her people."

Speaking to Bristenn, Dirra says, "Spurs you are called."

Speaking to Bristenn, Dirra says, "Not you but place."

Salnim frowns for a moment, a pained look upon his face.

Rowmi neutrally says, "Someone needs to absorb the blame.  Talador and her people are gone."

Mystiq says, "No one every will."

Dirra folds her hands behind her back.

Mynon says, "He stated that our help is not wanted, and seemed to consider it an added insult."

Salnim says, "The Desolation is the failure of many.  One which we will all bear in the time to come."

Bristenn nods gravely, clasping his hands behind his back.

Dirra cocks her head at Salnim.

Athalia frets a bit, and then places her hand upon Salnim's arm.

Dirra sinks down in a deep curtsy before Salnim, her lashes lowered.

Mynon nods slowly.

Bristenn respectfully concludes, "Such is all we have at present, my lord and lady."

Rowmi diplomatically urges, "Yet someone needs to absorb the blame."

Athalia inclines her head.

Salnim asks, "Having encountered this...Mureyk now twice, what is your assessment of him?"

Salnim glances between Bristenn and Mynon.

Speaking to Bristenn, Dirra says, "He blames the "swans' with red hot hatred."

(Dirra steps backwards, eyes lowered.)

Bristenn slowly offers, "From his movements, his physique, his bearing- he seems a veteran of numerous campaigns, and a highly capable armsmen."

(This one is longer than expected. I'll come back to it.)

You see Captain Martohck Hightower.
He appears to be a Human from Aldora.
He is taller than average and appears to be in the prime of life.  He has thick-lashed hazel eyes and tanned skin.  He has cropped, glossy chestnut hair with grey at the temples.  He has a clean-shaven face, a broad nose and broad shoulders.  He has a broken tree limb impaled through his side.
He has a fractured and bleeding right arm, some minor cuts and bruises on his right leg, some minor cuts and bruises on his left leg, deep lacerations across his chest, deep lacerations across his abdominal area, and minor lacerations about the head and a possible mild concussion.
He is bleeding slightly from the head, slightly from the right arm, from the abdomen, and from the chest.
He is holding a leather-wrapped white ora mace capped with a sharp spike in his right hand and a modwir-hilted feras short sword in his left hand.
He is wearing a winged veil iron helm, a thick red wool cloak lined with heavy fleece, a heavy black leather harness with a long-handled vultite spiked-hammer set with a wolf head pommel poking high overhead, a set of ornate veil iron field plate etched with a large wolf head, a pair of chain gloves with thick leather palms, a thick aged leather belt, and a pair of heavy mail boots.
