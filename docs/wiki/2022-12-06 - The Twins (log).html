<hr/>
<p><br/>
High Lord Grutak just came through a chiseled marble arch leading to the hallway.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Good evening."
</p><p>You see High Lord Grutak Eversor the Warmonger.
</p><p>He appears to be a Giantman of the T'Kirem Clan.
</p><p>He is tall.  He appears to be in the prime of life.  He has piercing green eyes and fair skin.  He has a bald head.  He has a square-jawed face, a broken nose and a short beard.
</p><p>He is in good shape.
</p><p>He is holding a dragonfly etched vultite no-dachi in his right hand.
</p><p>He is wearing some etched vultite full plate, a dull pendant suspended by a leather cord, a heavy onyx-dyed oilcloth greatcloak, an alum-bound rat hide badge, some fringed amber gloves, an imflass threaded war harness, a striped broadcloth backpack with padded cordovan straps, a loose stone grey linen shirt laced with black leather cord, an arctic-blue armband with gold tusks, a simple blued steel wristchain, a star-cut beryl band, a green buckskin sack, an enruned snow white pouch, some black suede pants caught with horn buttons, and a pair of pale fur-cuffed black suede boots.
</p><p>Grutak nods.
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Are you here to sign up for the Deligation?"
</p><p>Grutak says, "I am."
</p><p>You remove a frost blue parchment from in your eahnor-plated pack.
</p><p>In the Common language, it reads:
</p>
<pre>Icemule Deligates List
 The Lady Elliathe of Icemule.
 Chronicler Falvicar Jalcon The Blade of the Night
 Mr. Fropple Undertart, Warrior, Master at Arms of the Warrior Guild  
</pre>
<p>You reach toward your ear, and the quill releases its hold on your ear.  Twining several tentacles about your fingers it shifts itself into your hand.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Someone with intelligence needs to go on these sorts of things."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Do you have a statement you'd like to present to the council?"
</p><p>Grutak asks, "In person or in writing?"
</p><p>You quietly say, "Coverletter or message."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Coverletter would be prefered."
</p><p>Grutak says, "No, they never convey the right tone."
</p><p>You nod.
</p><p>You quietly say, "I understand."
</p><p>You quietly say, "You are always welcome to approach each council member to present your qualifications if you wish."
</p><p>You nod.
</p><p>In the Common language, it reads:
</p>
<pre>Icemule Deligates List
 The Lady Elliathe of Icemule.
 Chronicler Falvicar Jalcon The Blade of the Night
 Mr. Fropple Undertart, Warrior, Master at Arms of the Warrior Guild  
 High Lord Grutak Eversor the Warmonger
</pre>
<p>Grutak says, speaking to you, "If I thought it would do any good I would."
</p><p>Grutak says, "I know Nodyre will never approve of me."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Nor will you."
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Grutak, "Well you do have Icemule at heart."
</p><p>Grutak grins.
</p><p>Grutak says, "More than you would ever know."
</p><p>You quietly say, "I do not approve of your methods but that doesn't mean you are not worthy of the deligation."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Here's the thing though."
</p><p>Grutak says, "I'm going with or without the councils approval."
</p><p>Grutak says, "So might as well send me."
</p><p>Grutak says, "THat way you can at least attempt to muzzle me."
</p><p>You quietly say, "You are always welcome to go to Ta'Vaalor."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Welcome?  Not sure that's the right word."
</p><p>Grutak laughs!
</p><p>You quietly say, "Ta'Vaalor is open for outside visitation."
</p><p>Grutak says, "I was once kicked out for setting fire to one of their Inns for not letting me drink there."
</p><p>You quietly say, "I just returned from there a week ago."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Oh."
</p><p>Grutak says, "I'm sure the Legion won't be too happy to see me."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Well that is kind of a different situation"."
</p><p>You rub your selshis skin gloves.
</p><p>You quietly say, "I mean if your going to start trouble..."
</p><p>You quietly say, "That wouldn't help Icemule."
</p><p>Grutak asks, "Why is not starting trouble bad for Icemule?"
</p><p>You quietly say, "Bar fights are fun and all in the right circumstance even I've thrown my fair amount of punches."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Councilor, standing up and taking a beating and saying "thank you sir may I have another" is not helpful to Icemule."
</p><p>Grutak says, "At some point, you have to fight back."
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Grutak, "I mean if you go out there and punch someone in the face and say for Icemule and run.. be prepared to accept the concequinces that go with it."
</p><p>Grutak says, "More like cleave King Qalinor in two and then fight a pitched battle to get out the gate."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to you, "But I hear ya."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Did King Qalinor hurt you or your family?"
</p><p>Grutak smiles at you.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to you, "Now that's a personal question I'm not sure you are ready to hear the anwer too."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Perhaps but I'd like to try and understand."
</p><p>Grutak asks, "You are familiar with the highman games?"
</p><p>Grutak cocks his head at you.
</p><p>You quietly say, "I am not."
</p><p>Grutak says, "THe games held out the west gate."
</p><p>Grutak asks, "Khyber tossing and such?"
</p><p>Grutak asks, "Hammer throwing?"
</p><p>You quietly say, "Ohh yes."
</p><p>Grutak asks, "It's an annual thing with the GIantkin?"
</p><p>Grutak asks, "Do you know why that place was chosen as the location for such?"
</p><p>You shake your head.
</p><p>Grutak says, "The Giantkin have always had an affinity for Icemule."
</p><p>Grutak says, "It was not always just a home for Halflings."
</p><p>You agree with Grutak.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Though halfings have ruled here."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Giantkin once had a settlement here as well."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Our town has a lot of cultures that rest here."
</p><p>Grutak says, "We were here for a long time..."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Until the Vaalorians came."
</p><p>Grutak says, "They killed my mother and father and slaughtered many of my kindred."
</p><p>You ponder.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Men, women, even children."
</p><p>Grutak says, "My brother and I were captured and sold into slavery in New Ta'Faendryl."
</p><p>Grutak says, "But it was the Vaalorians that sold us, not Faendryl."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Thats terrible."
</p><p>Grutak says, "So when people talk about the Vaalorians as peace loving..."
</p><p>Grutak says, "I know better."
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to you, "But it gets worse."
</p><p>Grutak says, "We had a sister."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "We?"
</p><p>Grutak says, "My brother and I."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Oh yes brothers sold.. What happened to your sister?"
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Is she still alive?"
</p><p>You focus on projecting your thoughts.
</p><p>Grutak says, "She didn't survive the trip to New Ta'Faendryl."
</p><p>You lean back.
</p><p>You examine Grutak closely, sizing him up and taking note of all the details.
</p><p>You quietly ask, "How old were you when this happened Grutak?"
</p><p>Grutak says, "My brother and I were 10, my sister was 16."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Is your brother still alive?"
</p><p>You peer quizzically at Grutak.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Yes.  He has his own Mercenary company."
</p><p>Grutak says, "He doesn't do banditry, he escorts merchant caravans."
</p><p>You nod understandingly.
</p><p>You quietly ask, "How did you excape your bondage?"
</p><p>You mutter escape.
</p><p>Grutak says, "The old man saved us, sort of."
</p><p>Grutak says, "He raised Grutek, but left me at an orphanage... so he thought.  Was a child labor farm.  Just traded one form a slavery for another."
</p><p>Grutak says, "The old man died though a few years ago.  Poisoned in the Landing."
</p><p>You quietly exclaim, "Poisoned!"
</p><p>Grutak says, "That's how Grutek got his Merc company.  He was the old mans 2nd in command."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Was the old man not very nice?"
</p><p>You peer quizzically at Grutak.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Yes, he'd made enemies among the Nalfien."
</p><p>Grutak says, "He was a mercenary, they are never "nice"."
</p><p>Grutak chuckles.
</p><p>Grutak says, "I"m not nice either."
</p><p>You smile quietly to yourself.
</p><p>Grutak says, "The old man was a follower of Liabo and taught my brother to be the same."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Poison.. Well that's gentle compared to some ways to go."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "With him so close to landing are you two close again?"
</p><p>Grutak asks, "Ever watched someone die of nightshade?"
</p><p>Grutak says, "It's not gentle."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Not even remotely close."
</p><p>(Opalina shivers as she remember the foaming at the mouth of a dead guard recent dying of deathwart.. ')
</p><p>You quietly say, "I can imagine."
</p><p>You shake your head.
</p><p>You quietly ask, "Is your brother having issues in the south?"
</p><p>You quietly say, "His business must be taking a hit with the boundaries issues landing is having."
</p><p>Grutak says, "I'm not sure where he is at the moment exactly."
</p><p>The fire brings a welcome warmth that seems to soak into your very bones and makes you feel relaxed.
</p><p>Grutak says, "His last commission was to take a bunch of settlers to somewhere in the Locksmehr River area."
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Grutak, "I think that river is right along the dispute line."
</p><p>You nod.
</p><p>Grutak says, "I wouldnt' kill him if I saw him, but I probably won't help him either."
</p><p>Grutak says, "He's had all the lucky breaks.  My turn."
</p><p>You quietly ask, "You two aren't on the best terms?"
</p><p>You quietly say, "He's still your brother though."
</p><p>You sigh.
</p><p>Grutak says, "No.  We have philosophical differences."
</p><p>Grutak says, "He's a bit of a pacifist.  Ask questions, kill later.  I'm more of a kill now and worry about the blood stains later."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Complete opposites."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Sort of."
</p><p>Grutak says, "More like different sides of the same coin."
</p><p>Grutak says, "We are twins."
</p><p>You smile at Grutak.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Father called us the "little thunders" because we bellowed for mother’s teat as babes."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Thank you for that image Grutak."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Was that sarcasm?  Not sure truthfully."
</p><p>You smile at Grutak.
</p><p>You quietly say, "I promise I won't tease you in public little thunder."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Keep in mind that's a cherished memory."
</p><p>You gaze heavenward.
</p><p>Grutak says, "It is not going to embarrass me."
</p><p>Grutak grins.
</p><p>You quietly say, "Don't encourage me."
</p><p>Grutak chuckles.
</p><p>Grutak says, "A little chaos and destruction are good for the soul."
</p><p>You quietly say, "If you ever want to test that in the tavern I'll take ya up on it."
</p><p>You quietly say, "I may be little but I'm fast."
</p><p>Grutak says, "Glad you clarified, was going to ask if you were offering mothers milk."
</p><p>Grutak flashes a wide grin.
</p><p>You cough.
</p><p>Grutak says, speaking to you, "And just like that I'd knock you over with a feather."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Well High Lord Grutak I have your name down My hour is up."
</p><p>You stand back up.
</p><p>Grutak winks at you.
</p><p>Grutak says, "Very well."
</p><p>Grutak asks, "I trust you learned something tonight?"
</p><p>You say, speaking quietly to Grutak, "Yes, that you and I can talk with each other without wanting to tear out each other’s throats."
</p><p>Grutak says, "That's a start."
</p><p>Grutak nods.
</p><p>Grutak smiles.
</p><p>Grutak says, "I wish you a good evening Councilor."
</p><p>Grutak says, "A a merry Winferfest."
</p><p>You quietly say, "Good evening Grutak."
