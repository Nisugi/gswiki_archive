A dark riverstone statue occupies the center of the expansive public space, its height drawing attention to the dome that rises two stories overhead.  Silence hangs heavy on the night air, and the few citizens moving around the building do so with an air of dour resignation.  A few benches stand empty along the walls, which reflect the silvered moonlight that streams through the two entryside windows.  You also see the Tabubu disk, a fat ginger cat, the web-draped Missoni disk, a lazy wild brick red dog and a carved white stone staircase climbing to the second floor.
Also here: Neovik, Dragoon Dayzed, Aenternoll, Bakarus, Zeminar, Blades, Tabubu, Stormyrain, Lady Meliyara, Avaia, Commodore Jaysehn, Missoni, Perigourd, Magister Raelee, Defender of Mist Harbor Teaberry, Hadya, Mohrgan
Obvious exits: north, east, west, out

Bakarus says, "Nice to see so many friendly faces."

Aenternoll nods to you.

Stormyrain places a hand over her heart.

Blades leans against a dark riverstone statue.

Zeminar nods to you in greeting.

A distant crier announces, "Parties interested in the trial of Bakarus Klysus for high crimes against Icemule Trace should meet in the auditorium at Clovertooth Hall promptly!"

Speaking darkly to Bakarus, Zeminar asks, "Once exonerated, where shall the after party be?"

Talliver says, "Good evening, everyone."

Bakarus says, "A lovely turn out this evening."

Rammael says, "I apologize for my tardiness."

Teaberry says, "Well, there are plenty of dark elves present, Meliyara. Surely you think that your people are rational."

Rammael says, "Icemule Trace's justice system scarcely provides clear provisions for addressing such an alleged crime as this."

Rammael says, "As a result, it will be largely up to the selected judge to set the parameters for this trial."

Teaberry nods at Rammael.

Rammael says, "The documents of the early settlers of Icemule Trace are scattered at best, and largely incomplete."

Bakarus whispers to the group, "So things are unorganized and also made up by Teaberry.  Noted."

Rammael says, "Indeed, the Council of Ten were the last individuals to stand accused of such crimes, and they were found guilty."

Teaberry says, "Given what happened with them, I really do no think that burying people alive--or in lich form--is the way to go."

J&gt;look bakarus

You see Bakarus Klysus the Pilgrim.
He appears to be a Human from Jantalar.
He is average height.  He appears to be very young.  He has piercing black eyes and pale skin.  He has shoulder length, wavy black hair.  He has a square-jawed face, a classical nose and broad shoulders.  The fingertips of one hand are twisted and black, with a texture like corpseflesh.
He is in good shape.
He is holding a glass of Dhe'nari blood wine in his right hand.
He is wearing a strand of black ora prayerbeads, and some soft white silk robes.

Talliver glares at Bakarus.

Darcena says, "Really? I've found Bakarus incredibly polite at nearly all times."

Darcena furrows her brow.

Speaking to Jiarine, Bakarus says, "I was elected in this town, surely rational thought will rule the day."

Speaking to Teaberry, Rammael says, "The trial is yours to orchestrate.  I am, of course, here to advise."

Teaberry says, "From what I have been able to discover, in the absence of statutary law, common law prevails. So let's just treat this as a normal trial. Prosecution presents the list of charges and evidence if any, the defense tries to disprove the prosecution's case. Cross-examination and redirect are permitted but no one can introduce information on cross-examination or redirect that has no previously come up in questioning."

Naliya signals, "While I don't know the outcome of this, you have my vote, Bakarus."

Bakarus signals, "You have my thanks Naliya.  Too many here are eager for chaos and blood.  We have seen too much already."

Teaberry asks, "Master Perigourd, do you have any objection to the defense reading an opening statement?"

Speaking to Teaberry, Perigourd says, "I do not."

Speaking to Teaberry, Bakarus says, "If I may, I would like to state for the record I am the defendant in this case."

Speaking to Teaberry, Bakarus says, "I am being represented by L'Draggor, L'Draggor &amp; Kul'shin , LLP."

Speaking to Teaberry, Bakarus says, "First consult is free."

Zeminar nods once.

Speaking to you, Bakarus says, "Whenever you are ready, counsel."

Teaberry nods.

Aenternoll turns to face you.

You say, "I have been retained to speak on this matter of will and its manipulation."

You ask, "Am I not beautiful?"

You say, "That is what the vereri ask their victims. Melting away their resistance, immediately before their glamors drop..."

You say, "... and they are revealed, for what they truly are. Horribly grotesque and evil."

You say, "For you see, that is what the undead are, fundamentally. They are vile deceptions, pantomimes, twisted broken spirits."

Perigourd folds his hands behind his back.

You say, "They inflict crippling emotions with their very presence, and they compel the will of their victims."

You say, "There are all too many examples. Sheer fear, so called. Pookas drowning others in sorrow."

You say, "There are still more powerful assaults on the mind."

You say, "Bog wraiths hurling weapons with telekinesis."

You say, "Wind wraiths possessing Luukosian soul golems, troll wraiths forcing utter terror with songs, wraithlike banshees immobilizing with wails."

You say, "Vourkha are wraiths who make their victims follow them. Their eyes mindlessly glazing over and obeying."

You say, "Vereri themselves are vampiric, wraithlike lamia, who feed on blood and spirit."

You say, "As I understand it, their Temple of Hope is where this all began, with the Tablet of Death."

You say, "The demi-lich Zeban, possessing the body of another, then stole this powerful relic."

You ask, "... and what is a demi-lich, after all, if not a kind of vampiric wraith?"

You say, "Bereft of its phylactery. Forced to possess and feed upon others."

You say, "Liches are even known for staying the hand with dark empathy."

You ask, "Who here has never had their will compromised by the undead? Even possessed to assault others by demons?"

You say, "Marshal Thadston of Wehnimer's Landing was possessed by a haunted brothel worker."

You say, "Now? He is Mayor. How? It was not.. his... fault."

You ask, "Is it so difficult to believe that Zeban compelled Bakarus to kill, as he could not take the Tablet of Life from Sorlu while he lived?"

You ask, "That Bakarus cannot be reasonably expected to resist a demi-lich, who in that very moment was attempting to possess even Zerroth?"

You exclaim, "Zerroth! Whose berserker rage was so great, the Miscere'Golab itself was an extension of his will!"

You ask, "Now, I have no doubt some of you will question, how could we know if Bakarus was possessed and not a willing accomplice?"

You say, "I would tell you this. That such violations of the will may transcend momentary obvious symptoms."

You ask, "Was anyone able to tell, from mere casual observation, that Ellerel was possessed by Prangar?"

You ask, "Did not villainous figures, such as Elithain Cross, seem to be autonomous when they were truly pawns of Althedeus?"

You say, "Even forces of 'good' may be twisted. Consider the tainted disir, who are literally angels."

You say, "Consider the minions of the savant blood mage Grishom Stone, such as former museum curator Glethad, who is only an abject and servile illusion of free will."

You say, "Or Malluch Burdos, once a crusader against darkness who is now a zealot of that 'Blood God', after his shattered mind was 'healed' by Stone."

You say, "Think of how Tseleth, before he was even a lich, was able to control the will of others by exploiting soul fragments and symbols."

You say, "Speaking through Sir Bristenn Mires, a knight of Vornavis, who had no awareness of what he was saying."

You say, "Forcing Shannivar, an intercessor of Lorminstra, to kill others with her own hand."

You say, "This did not even require possession, only Luukosian black magic."

You say, "There are so many ways. Hex dolls, blood bonds, flesh marks."

You ask, "Is it not a well-known fact in this town that the accused, Bakarus Klysus, was seized upon and spoken through remotely by this Zeban?"

You say, "I confess confusion on how a man with the good name of Councilman Klysus could be thought a willing consort of Luukosians."

You say, "He is quite plainly a victim in all of this, just look at what Zeban did to his hand."

You say, "Truly, he might as well have the skull marking of Onar on his neck."

Teaberry says, "Actually, this is the first time I've heard of Bakarus being possessed."

You say, "Speaking to you as an outsider, someone with no stake in these matters, there is nothing here but reasonable doubt and hearsay."

You say, "... and, above all, you must remember. Possession is nine-tenths of the law."

You conclude, "It would be an injustice to convict Bakarus of these insults to his honor. Thank you."

Teaberry asks, "Mister Prosecutor, will you please state the charges, followed by your own arguments?"

Speaking honestly to Teaberry, Darcena says, "You know that I do not lie. It appeared at one time that Bakarus had been possessed by the lich. He did not seem to be using his own voice."

Perigourd says, "As I recall, the charges are Treason, murder, and collusion with a lich against the town of Icemule Trace."

Perigourd says, "With Treason and collusion constituting high crimes under the statues of Icemule."

Jiarine asks, "Do you the laws with you to prove that?"

Rammael says, "His understanding of the matter is accurate."

Rammael nods.

Perigourd says, "We just listened to much talk about possession, and many different forms of it."

Perigourd says, "And there is much truth in the fact that people can fall under the sway of such possesion, especially if their will is weak."

Perigourd says, "But he failed to address the fact that the council of ten has possessed members of this city before, or any of the manner in which they affected responded."

Perigourd says, "The crux of the matter isn't in his actions as many here were witness to Sorlu being murdered in order for Zeban to achieve the tablet."

Perigourd says, "I would like however to begin at the beginning with witness testimony as regards certain facts."

Perigourd says, "I would call Coucnilman Roelon to questioning."

Roelon deeply says, "Aye.  Ask what ye will."

Rammael says, "If it please the judge..."

Rammael says, "I believe the opening statement must conclude before the questioning of any witnesses begins."

Teaberry asks, "Is your opening statement concluded, Master Perigourd?"

Speaking to Teaberry, Perigourd says, "It will be momentarily then, I'll hold my questions till after."

Teaberry says, "Go on."

Perigourd says, "It's been stated at meetings that information was being passed by a spy within Icemule trace to the benefit of Zeban, we intend to present evidence that links Bakarus as the culprit."

Perigourd says, "We also intend to prove that such matters had to have been of his own volition, and that such possessions as described were not in force at the time of his actions."

Perigourd says, "Thank you."

Teaberry says, "At the moment, we do not have a time limit. And yes, the prosecution may present its first witness."

Speaking to Bakarus, Mystiq asks, "Are you in a hurry to be framed?"

Perigourd says, "Then I again call Councilman Roelon to question."

Speaking to Mystiq, Bakarus asks, "Its that obvious?"

Speaking to Bakarus, Mystiq says, "Well..."

Speaking to Roelon, Perigourd asks, "Councilman, during the strife regarding Zeban's threat to the town, were you aware that information was being passed to Zeban by a source within the town?"

Speaking deeply to Perigourd, Roelon says, "We were made aware of such ah person within our town doin' this, aye."
 
[Clovertooth, Auditorium]
Raw cedar timbers perfume the air, comprising the walls of the expansive hall.  Living evergreen boughs contrast frame the southern entrance, brightly illuminated by faceted glimaerstone orbs set high into the ceiling.  The light scatters over a few dozen rows of comfortably padded seats and rugs covering parts of the polished floor.  A central aisle delineated by a quartet of braziers leads toward an expansive cedar and pine stage framed by silver-trimmed blue curtains.  You also see the oleaginous Whisker disk trailing slick ebon tentacles, the faenor Queatus disk inlaid with intersecting bands of jet, the Fyg disk, the Quildor disk, the Naliya disk, the Tabubu disk, the web-draped Missoni disk and a stocky snow white puppy with oversized black-tipped paws.

Obvious exits: south

Roelon deeply says, "Ah believe it was first brought to our attention, by the seer Kadya."

Roelon deeply says, "She did nae name the person outright. Nae. But rather, told us of ah sigil, carved of wood with ah star inverted. This would lead us to the person."

Speaking to Roelon, Perigourd asks, "Did you ever witness this sigil on anyone?"

Roelon deeply says, "Ah mahself did nae witness this sigil, there hae been warnings by others however about this."

Speaking to Roelon, Perigourd asks, "Which others, if I might ask?"

Roelon deeply says, "Darcena, as ah recall."

Zeminar darkly says, "I'll be doing the cross examination, if it please Your Honor."

Teaberry says, "That's fine. Please proceed."

Speaking darkly to Roelon, Zeminar asks, "Mr. Roelon, You have known Mr. Klysus for quite a long time, correct?"

Rammael inclines his ear, listening intently.

Speaking deeply to Zeminar, Roelon says, "Before the troubles here, ah hae known him ah bit. Aye. Slowly, knowing him ah bit more as ah fellow Councilor."

Speaking darkly to Roelon, Zeminar asks, "Roelon...Yes, have you known Bakarus to be anything other than a good councilman, someone who you have fought side by side with many times?"

Zeminar darkly says, "Please, a simple yes will do."

Roelon deeply says, "Ah hae known Bakarus as both the good councilor and one who struck ah fatal blow to another."

Zeminar darkly asks, "You bore witness to the lich speaking through Bakarus, clearly targeting him for possession, did you not?"

Roelon deeply says, "Ah hae heard Zeban speak through Bakarus. Ah cannae confirm or denie if he was possesed or ah vessel."

Zeminar darkly says, "Yes of course."

Zeminar darkly says, "So it's not unreasonable, that the friend you knew, and the one who struck the fatal blow you described, are not the same person."

Zeminar darkly asks, "And Bakarus, has ever talked to you about feeling better after the ordeal?"

Roelon deeply says, "He has mentioned such words to me, aye."

Speaking deeply to Teaberry, Dayzed says, "Your honor, I highly recommend finding a new prosecutor for this case. The appointed one is not doing their duty."

Aenternoll says, "Objection. The gallery has no place directing either counsel."

Teaberry says, "Zeminar, your questions are becoming argumentative. Please watch yourself. You should not be testifying."

Zeminar darkly asks, "Moving along then.  Mr. Roelon, do you know what goddess Kadya claims bestowed her her gift of sight?"

Zeminar darkly asks, "And would you trust someone who has faith in Eorgina?"

Zeminar darkly asks, "Mr. Roelon, the sigil, were you referring to a pentagram, correct?"

Zeminar darkly asks, "A commonly worn symbol, correct?"

Perigourd says, "Objection."

Perigourd asks, "How is the witness to know what is or isn't a commonly worn symbol amongst the masses?"

Perigourd asks, "Does he sell them?"

Bakarus says, "Eyes."

Bakarus says, "He has them."

Zeminar darkly says, "If the witness doesn't know if a pentagram is a common symbol, then he is a very poor witness."

Roelon deeply says, "Might be commonly sold aye. But not so common amung those who were around us."

Roelon deeply asks, "Otherwise we'd hae quite a few more suspects some time ago. Aye?"

Zeminar darkly says, "A wooden pentagram charm is a sensible thing to wear if one is worried about being malignly afflicted or hexed by a possessing force."

Zeminar darkly asks, "You know, like if there was some kind of vampiric demi-lich around...  Correct?"

Perigourd says, "Objection, leading the witness to a conclusion."

Speaking deeply to Bakarus, Dayzed says, "We might as well just acquit you now."

Speaking darkly to Teaberry, Zeminar says, "I'm asking very sensible questions here."

Zeminar darkly says, "I don't need an answer for that one."

Zeminar darkly asks, "Councilor Roelon, could you characterize your relationship with the judge Teaberry?"

Perigourd says, "Objection, relevance."

Rammael glances at Teaberry.

Roelon deeply says, "Next ye will ask me what kilt size ah wear? Ye might be suprised."

Speaking darkly to Roelon, Zeminar says, "Justice is not fun.  And these questions are very important, so please be patient Mr. Roelon."

Teaberry says, "Objection sustained."

Zeminar darkly asks, "Mr. Roelon, would you say you are close friends with Judge Teaberry?"

Teaberry asks, "Mr. Zeminar, in what way does my relationship with Roelon have anything to do with whether or not Bakarus killed someone and betrayed the town?"

Zeminar darkly says, "Clearly, clearly a conflict of interest, your honor."

Zeminar darkly says, "No further questions."

Zeminar sits down.

Speaking to Teaberry, Perigourd asks, "If I may redirect, your honor?"

Teaberry says, "Go ahead."

Speaking to Roelon, Perigourd asks, "Councilman Roelon, during the events surrounding Zeban, did you ever once take note of anyone involved wearing a pentegram sigil, even in passing?"

Roelon deeply says, "Honestly? Ah nae personally seen such directly. Nae."

Speaking to Roelon, Perigourd asks, "Have you ever known anyone to wear such a symbol in an attempt to ward off the magic or potential possessions of another malevolent force?"

Roelon deeply says, "Ah dinnae use such methods. But ah cannae say for others. Ah dinnae recall seeing them often enough."

Speaking to Roelon, Perigourd says, "Thank you councilman."

Perigourd says, "I call Captain Darcena Wolf-Valslayer to question."

Darcena asks, "Yes?"

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "Were you present at the time the seer Kadya gave the warning that Councilman Roelon spoke of in his testimony?"

Darcena says, "Yes."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "And what was the warning Kadya gave, if we can hear your own description of it?"

Darcena says, "Kadya informed us that she could see a sigil of wood, carved with a star inverted, which would lead us to the betrayer."

Perigourd asks, "And did you see this symbol on anyone since the warning?"

Darcena simply says, "Yes."

Perigourd asks, "Is that person in this room?"

Darcena says, "Yes."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "Who did you see wearing this symbol?"

Darcena says, "I have a question, however. When I immediately informed Archernar, Iseo, Kittai, Teaberry, Gespry, Lauranathalasa, Earthdiver, Joskin, Neovik, Randsford, Erienne, Ycelacie, Mearyn, Roelon, Kobane, Sorlu, Jiarine, Sorrenn, and Dayzed of the symbol and asked follow-up questions, they deemed at that time that my suspicions were not worth listening to me."

Darcena says, "They evaluated the situation and decided that my observations and thoughts were not valid."

Darcena angrily says, "How amusing that suddenly now it is worth listening to the Captain of the Wehnimer's Landing Militia and a Council person for the Order of hte Silver Gryphons."

Darcena says, "Someone known to never lie."

Darcena asks, "Are some of those people not here as well?"

Sorlu says, "I most certainly said no such thing."

Darcena asks, "Those who did not heed my words at all?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Darcena says, "I'll answer your question, squire."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd says, "If you would."

Darcena says, "Bakarus was the one wearing the symbol. The one whom all around dismissed my concerns as they did not feel that it was important or representative of him then. Weird how suddenly they do now."

Darcena asks, "Is it not possible they are looking for a scapegoat to pin their own ignorance upon?"

Mystiq says, "Sure they are."

Darcena fiercely growls, "Or perhaps they should have listened."

Maylan asks, "Isn't that what a trial is for?"

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "Did you ever speak to Bakarus regarding the sigil?"

Lylia murmurs, "And yet she is the one who has the floor, when she was not granted it in the past. Who can blame her for taking that opportunity."

Speaking to Randsford, Stormyrain whispers aloud, "Isn't that exactly what this is? Accusations against Bakarus?"

Speaking to Perigourd, Darcena says, "Yes."

Rammael coughs.

Rammael says, "Please leave the speaking to those recognized."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "Can you summarize the conversation you had with him about it?"

Darcena says, "When I spoke with him initially I both said outloud that Kadya had mentioned a wooden inverted star and glanced at him. I then asked him if he would allow me to see his jewelry. He said, and I will never forget, so I quote, 'Stay away from me she wolf.' It was very disrespectful. I then informed Dayzed directly of the conversation and he declined to follow up on it."

Darcena says, "I then continued to talk that evening and indicate that Bakarus was wearing a pentagram, including directly to Randsford himself."

Darcena says, "Who declined to follow up on it as well."

Darcena says, "I also told Jiarine directly that it was openly being worn."

Darcena says, "And was ignored once again."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "After Bakarus asked you to stay away from him, did you have any further interaction with him?"

Darcena says, "Yes."

Darcena says, "He often comes to bandits in Solhaven."

Darcena says, "He is a town councilor of Icemule Trace and is at many of these similar events as well."

Darcena says, "He also sometimes resurrects me in the Hinterwilds when I have died."

Darcena mutters, "Which is really damned useful."

Bakarus says, "I only wish to serve."

Arianiss: "Barakus, Bakarus's evil twin!"

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "Do you believe he betrayed Icemule?"

Arianiss: "He's been innocent this whole time!"

Arianiss: "Also not to be confused with Baracus.. he's a good guy.."

Darcena says, "That is an excellent question. I am not Koar nor Ghezresh."

Darcena says, "I believe you will need to be more specific in your question. That is impossible to answer."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "Do you know of any instance in which you saw, heard or came into knowledge of Bakarus passing information to the lich Zeban?"

Darcena breathes, "Yes."

Darcena quickly adds, "We all do know about this, as well. Zeban saw through his eyes."

Darcena says, "Whether intended or not, he was always passing information to Zeban in some way."

Aenternoll says, "Objection. The witness is speculating."

Teaberry says, "Sustained."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "Do you know of any information that Bakarus acquired outside of his alleged possession that was passsed by him willingly to the lich Zeban?"
The bright luminescence fades from around Geijon.

Darcena says, "I do not remember the specifics of any information to share with you."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "But there was information passed willingly?"

Darcena asks, "Is that a question?"

Aenternoll says, "Objection. The prosecution is attempting to lead the witness."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "Was there any information passed willingly from Bakarus to the lich Zeban that you know of?"

Darcena says, "Yes."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "Do you know what the details of THAT information was?"

Mystiq asks, "How would anyone truely know that?"

Darcena says, "Many of us shared information willingly with Zeban such as that we would be coming after him soon."

Speaking sincerely to Perigourd, Darcena says, "I do not remember any details of what kind of information Bakarus may have passed to Zeban himself."

Xorus is very amused.

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "How do you know he passed information willingly to Zeban?"

Darcena says, "Some of it I witnessed, as did we all, and he also told me."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "Was any of this information regarding the defense of the city?"

Darcena surprisedly says, "Oh, that is a very good question."

Darcena says, "I do remember making some assumptions and hearing some accusations from others that he may have passed information about patrols and defense information about the city to Zeban. This, however, I did not directly witness myself and I was not present in the defense meetings to know for sure."

Darcena says, "It was also information that was widely being rumored across the city at the time."

Darcena says, "Some seemed true, some seemed not."

Speaking to Perigourd, Darcena says, "I am afraid that is not how you corner me, squire."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "What information did Bakarus tell you he passed to Zeban?"

Darcena says, "You have already asked this question, and I have already answered it."

Bakarus asks, "Can this just go on...indefinitely?"

Zeminar darkly says, "Objection, badgering the witness at this point."

Teaberry says, "Please wrap this up, counselor."

Darcena asks, "Squire," she pauses and watches him evenly with feral eyes, "Do you have anything else?"

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd says, "I have a final question."

Darcena says, "At the time of Zeban's initial threats to the city, there were no other betray--"

Darcena patiently asks, "Yes?"

Teaberry says, "The question presumes that the defendant is a spy."

Darcena says, "I will finish my sentence nonetheless."

Darcena says, "No other betrayers known than the one Kadya warned us of."

Speaking to Darcena, Perigourd asks, "How many spies were working for Zeban during his threat to Icemule, and what were their names?"

Darcena says, "When Zeban threatened Icemule, we were warned of only one betrayer in the town."

Darcena says, "I informed the town at that time I believed it to be Bakarus."

Darcena says, "As I have already said."

Darcena says, "I was discounted by the good people of Icemule."

Roelon deeply says, "Fearful citizens sometimes don't listen. Ah apologize as well if ah was such ah citizen."

Randsford says, "As do I, however to say we ignored the warning is to say context is lacking."

Meliyara idly says, "Goodness, I did not realize so many witnesses were on the stand with Darcena all at once."

Zeminar darkly says, "All of this, originating from a witch of Eorgina."

Zeminar darkly says, "No questions your honor."

Perigourd says, "I would like to call former Councilman Arianiss Winterfox to questioning."

Arianiss says, "Yes."

Zeminar whispers to the group, "I at least hope they have a club sandwich lunch break out in the hallway."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "Councilman, were you also informed that there was an individual passing information within Icemule to the lich Zeban?"

Arianiss says, "Not directly at the time, but I tried to stay on top of current events, so yes I was aware there was a traitor."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "Did you come up with an idea to attempt to discover the identity of this traitor?"

Arianiss says, "No."

Arianiss says, "Well.."

Arianiss says, "I broached it maybe, but it was just talk with other Councillors."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "During the drill session with the Crimson Legion, did you have a private conversation with Bakarus?"

Arianiss says, "Yes."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "What was talked about during this conversation?"

Arianiss says, "An idea I had for the use of the Crimson Legion, Silver Gryphons, and Town Guard."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "Did you tell this idea to anyone else at any other time?"

Arianiss says, "No."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "Was anyone immediately in your vicinity when this was discussed?"

Arianiss says, "Not that I could detect."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "Was this conversation spoken aloud?"

Arianiss says, "It was not."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "After this discussion, was a note found containing the details of the idea you shared with Bakarus?"

Arianiss says, "Yes."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "How long after this conversation took place?"

Arianiss says, "Based on the better recollection of Aethyra, the next evening."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "Who was the note addressed to?"

Arianiss says, "I don't remember.  Zeban or Arnabas.. but it was a pristine version of the one Reiphe shared with us at the town meeting."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "Was the note signed?"

Arianiss says, "Yes."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "What was the signature?"

Arianiss says, "A stylized B."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "Has Bakarus ever been possessed in your presence?"

Arianiss says, "To my non-expert opinion, yes."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "When this happened, did his manner or appearance change from the norm?"

Arianiss says, "To my perception and awareness, just his voice."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "How did his voice change?"

Arianiss says, "Didn't sound like him.. I don't remember the specifics.  Whatever it was, was attempting to be thought of as Zeban."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd asks, "Have you ever heard Bakarus' voice to change similarly since?"

Arianiss says, "No."

Zeminar darkly says, "He isn't possessed anymore..."

Speaking to Arianiss, Perigourd says, "Thank you sir, that is all I had."

Arianiss says, "You're welcome."

Zeminar darkly says, "We shall cross examine."

Arianiss says, "Yes."

Speaking darkly to Arianiss, Zeminar says, "The case resides on wether or not Mr. Klysus was possessed."

Arianiss says, "Okay."

Speaking darkly to Arianiss, Zeminar asks, "Which you testified that indeed he was, correct?"

Zeminar darkly asks, "You testified to this?"

Arianiss says, "It appeared to me that he was during the meeting, yes."

Zeminar darkly says, "Yes of course."

Zeminar darkly says, "I have a parchment here, that was also found."

Arianiss adds, "The town meeting, not the drill session."

Zeminar darkly says, "In a dark alley in this here town.  Among the excrements and fluids."

Zeminar darkly says, "I shall read this parchment."

Arianiss says, "Okay."

Zeminar darkly says, "In the common language, of course."

Zeminar darkly says, "Counselor Gespry."

Perigourd says, "Objection, the defense is presenting evidence which hasn't been proven to be relevant to the questioning of the witness."

Speaking darkly to Teaberry, Zeminar says, "This is quite relevant."

Perigourd asks, "How are we to know how the witness can testify to anything regarding it when no connection to Councilman Arianiss' knowledge has been made?"

Zeminar darkly says, "I am proving a point, your honor."

Teaberry asks, "What is the point, counselor?"

Zeminar darkly says, "These letters...  This B...  It has no legal weight within a courtroom."

Zeminar darkly says, "We have a posessed man.  Being set up for slaughter."

Zeminar darkly says, "The court has clearly seen he was possessed."

Teaberry says, "It's getting late and there is much yet to discover. I declare the court in recess until the evening of Feastday the 9th, 9:30 elven time."

Teaberry says, "I look forward to seeing you again in three days."

Rammael says, "I will let everyone know what delayed Mayor Dabbings."

Rammael says, "...once I have found that out myself."
