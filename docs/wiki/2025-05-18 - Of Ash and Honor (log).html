[Cholen's Temple, Auditorium]
The Performance Hall is a grand chamber filled with rows of cushioned benches facing a stage at the far end.  The stage has generous proportions -- heavy indigo curtains flank it on either side.  A row of lanterns placed along its lip are hooded on the sides facing the audience, with all their illumination directed toward center-stage.  You also see the Sirona disk, a ruby-set copper crate, a white monir table burned with a keep-overlooked seaside cityscape with some stuff on it, a grand arched doorway and the proscenium steps.
Also here: Xorus, Dame Deavon who is sitting, Sister-in-arms Mourdeyan, Protector Kilthal who is sitting, Lady Erienne, Leifa, Master Fisher Aerocus who is sitting, Saesyra, Sir Tebon, Sirona who is sitting, Xanthalas who is sitting, Kasgar who is sitting, Magister Raelee, Kippe, Gardener Brigit, High Lord Everall, Dame Evia, Goldstr, Riend who is sitting, Ashendoth who is sitting, Lady Raindove who is sitting, Sir Balantine who is sitting

In the Common language, it reads:

                    The Order of the Silver Gryphons Presents:
                                 "Ash and Honor"
                     A Historical Reenactment of Our Origins
                          Written by Delindra Talissen
                                 Performed by:

                       18 Ivastaen, 5125


Balantine recites quietly:

    "Welcome one and all, playbills are in the crate, and refreshments on the table"



The auditorium lights slowly dim as a hush fills the room.

The curtain slowly opens.

Glancing up on stage you see...

[Cholen's Temple, Stage]
The stage lighting -- created by evenly spaced oil lamps hung over the proscenium -- illuminates the wide-planked stage.  A new coat of polish is unable to hide the scuffs and marks left by decades of actors.  You also see the stage left entrance, the stage right entrance, the proscenium steps and the stage curtain.
Also here: Perigourd who is sitting
Obvious exits: none

Kothos just came through the stage right entrance.

Sir Guarrin just came through the stage right entrance.

Kothos folds his hands behind his back.

Perigourd sits behind a richly appointed desk of mahogany, shuffling papers with an air of nonchalance. He does not look up as Sir Maldon and Lieutenant Wellesborne enter, allowing them to wait for him in silence.

Guarrin folds his hands behind his back.

Perigourd crisply asks, "Sir Maldon.' He glances briefly at the older man, then the younger. 'Lieutenant Wellesborne. I trust your journey was without incident?"

Guarrin stands before Baron Hochstib, posture rigid, eyes fixed straight ahead. He exudes an air of military efficiency, tempered with quiet command bred from years of experience in the field.

Perigourd glances between Guarrin and Kothos.

Guarrin formally says, "Aye, Baron Hochstib. The roads were clear."

Kothos casts a glance at Sir Maldon, then straightens his posture as if to mimic the older man. He speaks with eager, youthful vigor.

Kothos adds, "We made good time from Vornavis."

Perigourd stands up from the desk, turning his back to the two men as he gazes outward, surveying the lands of Jantalar through a wide window. He nods approvingly.

Perigourd decisively says, "Good. I have use for men of action.' He pauses, turning to face the older knight. 'Sir Maldon, I am assigning you command of a Holding near Wehnimer's Landing. It holds strategic value for expanding Jantalar's influence."

Guarrin interestedly asks, "A Holding, milord?"

Perigourd turns to face Guarrin.

Perigourd declares, "A foothold. The Landing wallows in independence. You will bring order and fly Jantalar s colors."

Guarrin nods once and issues a crisp salute, sharp gaze focused straight ahead.

Guarrin states, "I will serve, milord."

Perigourd turns to Lieutenant Wellesborne, surveying him up and down before issuing his next order.

Kothos turns to face Perigourd.

Kothos bows to Perigourd.

Perigourd says, "And *you*, Lieutenant, are bound for Talador. There's unrest in the mines. Dwarven filth, elven agitators criminals. They forget who rules them. Remind them."

Kothos straightens further, issuing a salute that mirrors Sir Maldon's.

Kothos crisply says, "Yes, milord."

Perigourd declares, "I want order restored. These sympathizers are not citizens. They are *property*. Make them remember."

Perigourd's entire body tenses as he clenches his fist.

Kothos nods once.

Guarrin states, "As you command."

Kothos states, "Long live Jantalar."

Perigourd sits back down at his desk, making a noncommittal gesture to dismiss both men.

Perigourd just went through the stage left entrance.

Guarrin moves across the stage as the light shifts, casting the Baron's study in darkness. The faint suggestion of a stone hallway appears as he and the Lieutenant walk together in silence for a moment.

Kothos turns to face Guarrin.

Kothos stops suddenly, forcing Sir Maldon to come to a stop alongside him. He hesitates, then speaks.

Kothos stares at Guarrin.

Kothos clears his throat.

Kothos haltingly says, "Sir Maldon... I must speak. The mines... the prisoners in there. I've heard of the conditions. They are dying there, Sir. And I've heard rumors. That it's not just criminals. It's... anyone who speaks out."

Guarrin turns to face the Lieutenant, regarding him for a moment, then places his hand on Wellesborne's shoulder.

You quietly whisper to Xorus, "Well, then."

Guarrin states, "Remember our duty. We do not question our liege lord. The mines punish the disloyal and enrich the realm."

Kothos hesitantly asks, "But what if it's wrong?"

Kothos stares at Guarrin.

Guarrin pauses a long moment, giving the question serious consideration. He speaks slowly.

Guarrin heavily says, "Then we carry it   so others don't have to."

Kothos slowly empties his lungs.

Kothos nods slowly.

Kothos quietly says, "Yes, Sir Maldon."

Kothos folds his hands behind his back.

Guarrin gives the Lieutenant a respectful, approving nod. He continues through the hallway as Wellesborne lingers behind, watching the older man depart.

Kothos stares at the stage right entrance.

Sir Guarrin just went through the stage right entrance.

Kothos softly says, "Yes... Father."

Kothos sighs.

Kothos just went through the stage left entrance.

The curtain slowly closes.

The curtain slowly opens.

[Cholen's Temple, Stage]
The stage lighting -- created by evenly spaced oil lamps hung over the proscenium -- illuminates the wide-planked stage.  A new coat of polish is unable to hide the scuffs and marks left by decades of actors.  You also see the stage left entrance, the stage right entrance, the proscenium steps and the stage curtain.
Also here: Kothos who is sitting
Obvious exits: none

Kothos sits behind a battered field desk, the walls of a command tent strung up about him. From without, the sounds of fighting ring, though distantly. He holds a quill in hand, scrawling a letter.

Delindra just came through the stage right entrance.

Delindra strides in, stopping short before Lieutenant Wellesborne and managing a ragged salute.

Delindra hastily says, "My Lord, the mines. They cannot hold much longer. The prisoners are making a final push... your officers will soon be overrun."

Kothos put a metallic onyx raven feather quill in his leather satchel.

Kothos glances at Delindra.

Kothos nods once.

Kothos stands up.

Kothos rises from his chair and folds the crisp parchment in his hand in one movement. He hands the letter to the messenger, then retrieves his sword belt from the stand beside his chair, pulling it on with practiced ease.

Kothos states, "You must take this letter to my father.' He hesitates, then speaks with quiet reluctance. 'We shall do as the Baron commands. We shall hold the line."

Delindra slowly empties her lungs.

Kothos offers Delindra a piece of plain white paper.

Delindra nods slowly.

Delindra accepts Kothos's plain white paper.

Delindra nods once and rushes out.

Delindra just went through the stage right entrance.

Kothos strides out on the heels of the messenger, sword leaving its sheath in a hiss as he charges forth. The stage goes dark. The sounds of battle grow louder. All that can be heard is the clash of steel upon steel, voices crying out in victory and defeat as weapons find their homes in flesh.

Kothos grabs a lacquered toy modwir sword from inside his thick leather knapsack.

Kothos just went through the stage left entrance.

Kothos just came through the stage right entrance.

Delindra just came through the stage right entrance.

Delindra recites:

    "The sounds of battle fill the mines
     Betrayal, worst of the nobles' crimes
     Through the chaos, shadow cloaked
     The mines are felled, the entry choked.
     In the rubble, a fallen son
     This one mistake: all faith undone."

Delindra just went through the stage right entrance.

Kothos flicks a match as the flame lights his face and the area around him. Bodies are sprawled among the images of fallen rocks and beams, the space small and claustrophobic. Lieutenant Wellesborne surveys his surroundings, all hope gone from his expression.

Kothos bitterly says, "The cost of obedience to a liege lord who has forgotten all Nobility."

Kothos bows his head as the flame gutters out.

Kothos hangs his head.

The curtain slowly closes.

The curtain slowly opens.

Glancing up on stage you see...

[Cholen's Temple, Stage]

A new coat of polish is unable to hide the scuffs and marks left by decades of actors.  You also see the stage left entrance, the stage right entrance, the proscenium steps and the stage curtain.
Also here: Sir Guarrin
Obvious exits: none

Guarrin is settled around a campfire with his retinue, who are raising mugs of ale high as laughter permeates the air. The scene is interrupted by the sound of hoofbeats announcing the arrival of a messenger.

Delindra just came through the stage right entrance.

Delindra dashes in, bedraggled and covered in dust. She immediately approaches Sir Maldon, oblivious to the other soldiers around him. She renders a hasty salute and extends the missive with her other hand.

Delindra offers Guarrin a piece of plain white paper.

Delindra breathlessly says, "Sir Maldon! Urgent dispatch from Talador."

Guarrin accepts Delindra's plain white paper.

Guarrin rises from his place by the fire as the laughter fades, replaced with silent dread. All look on, watching with trepidation. Sir Maldon unfolds the worn parchment, eyes roving over the page as his face remains passive.

The voice of Kothos recites clearly:

    "Father:
     I have done my best to carry my duty with honor.  I wish for you to know that.  Still, I worry that I have not done enough.  That I have fallen short of the legacy you hoped I would uphold."

Guarrin clenches his fist as he continues reading, a look of dread crossing his features.

The voice of Kothos recites concernedly:

    "There are rumors.. whispers that the mines will be collapsed to end the uprising in one brutal stroke. I pray it is not true. I pray the Baron would not do such a thing. But even in doubt, I have tried to believe in his vision. In his nobility."

The voice of Kothos recites firmly:

    "We make one final push tonight. If we succeed, I hope to return to Jantalar... and see you again with honor intact.
     If we fail... I hope you will forgive me."

Guarrin slowly lowers slowly lowers the letter, his face unreadable in the firelight. He turns to the Messenger.

Guarrin curtly asks, "The mines?"

Delindra hesitates, lowering her gaze. A hush falls over the camp like a veil.

Delindra quietly says, "The tunnels collapsed, Sir. I heard the crash as I left the camp. From the rumors that followed me here... They say... no one made it out."

Delindra pauses, taking a deep breath and closing her eyes.

Delindra haltingly says, "Your son. He... was inside when it happened."

Guarrin does not move as the fire crackles behind him and his soldiers look on, silent. Slowly, he folds the letter, then lifts his gaze, staring into the distance.

Guarrin murmurs, "And so may end the line of Wellesborne."

Guarrin lowers his gaze again as the stage goes dark.

The curtain slowly closes.

The curtain slowly opens.

Glancing up on stage you see...

[Cholen's Temple, Stage]
The stage lighting -- created by evenly spaced oil lamps hung over the proscenium -- illuminates the wide-planked stage.  A new coat of polish is unable to hide the scuffs and marks left by decades of actors.  You also see the stage left entrance, the stage right entrance, the proscenium steps and the stage curtain.
Also here: Jisandra, Sir Guarrin, Sir Cryheart, Lady Missoni, Peatwyn
Obvious exits: none

Jisandra stands among a group of townsfolk, the surroundings of Wehnimer's Landing depicted in sharp relief in the background. Opposite the group stands Sir Maldon and his retinue, the banners of Jantalar hanging limply at their backs.

Jisandra flatly says, "That's close enough, knight."

Peatwyn calls, "Yes. Lady Wanton is right - keep your distance."

Missoni fixes her gaze on Guarrin.  Her eyes narrow and she exhales a stifled-sounding *huff*.  Is she trying to glare at him?

Missoni states, "You are not welcome here."

Cryheart growls, "What makes you think you can come here?"."

Jisandra moves forward to confront Sir Maldon directly, her hand on the hilt of her weapon, though she does not draw it yet. Her eyes are fierce.

Jisandra growls, "We ve heard what your Baron s done in Talador. You won t bring his tyranny here - not while we still draw breath. This is our town. Lady Cinabar and I will not stand aside - neither will Lord Brinn or Lord Welan - and let you take it as you please."

Missoni strides over to stand before Jisandra.

Missoni nods her agreement, stepping up beside Lady Wanton, her arms folded and jaw set.

Guarrin stands still and silent, his gaze lowered. He takes a deep breath, then seems to come to a decision. He steps forward.

Guarrin quietly announces, "I did not come here for conquest."

Missoni glances skeptically at Guarrin.


Jisandra narrows her eyes with suspicion, regarding Maldon with a scowl.

Jisandra frowns.

Guarrin quietly continues, "I believed in my liege lord... in Baron Hochstib. I believed I served a vision of order and strength. But I was wrong."

Guarrin removes his gauntlet and lets it fall to the ground with a muted clink.

Guarrin softly says, "My son died in Talador. Crushed beneath stone... in a trap laid for innocents and called justice.' He pauses, then continues, the weight heavy in his voice. 'And I stood by. I called it duty."

Missoni furrows her brow.

Jisandra skeptically asks, "And yet you come here, clad in those colors, the banners of conquest behind you. Why should we trust you?"

Guarrin regards Lady Wanton for a long, tense moment, then turns. He seizes one of the banners held by a member of his retinue, who makes only the smallest gesture of protest. He rips the banner from its stand and flings it to the ground.

Missoni glances down.

Guarrin states, "I stand here, not as a commander of Jantalar - but as a man who seeks to atone."

Jisandra raises an eyebrow.

Guarrin firmly continues, "I seek to build something better. Not for conquest, but for brotherhood. If the Landing had its own knightly order, standing against cruelty, whose charge is to protect the people - an order dedicated to defending honor, not power... then perhaps we stand a chance."

Guarrin lifts his gaze to address the townspeople at large.

Guarrin loudly demands, "Who among you would stand with me?"

Jisandra tilts her head and gazes at Sir Maldon long enough for his words to echo into silence. Then, she steps forward, bringing her fist to her chest.

Missoni glances at Jisandra.

Jisandra quietly says, "For my town and for the people here who cannot protect themselves... I will."

Missoni nods once.

Missoni firmly says, "For so long as your cause is just, I shall ally myself to your cause."

Cryheart quickly says, "And so shall I..."

Peatwyn eagerly says, "And I."

Peatwyn nods grimly.

Guarrin regards the line forming before him and nods with satisfaction. Behind, the glow of the village shifts from stark and grey to warm amber. As the stage fades to black, an emblem is revealed unfurled above the proscenium, the image of a gryphon depicted in silver overhead.

The curtain slowly closes.

The curtain slowly opens.

Glancing up on stage you see...
[Cholen's Temple, Stage]

Also here: Jisandra who is sitting, Sir Guarrin who is sitting, Sir Cryheart who is sitting, Lady Missoni who is sitting, Peatwyn who is sitting
Obvious exits: none

Peatwyn sits with his feet propped up on a table that was once grand and ornate, but has succumbed to the ravages of time. Around him are walls of time-worn stone and crumbling finery, the vestiges of a keep that has fallen to ruin.

Peatwyn laughingly says, "...so I was watching this fellow square off with an ogre twice his size. I was going to help, but then he trips and his sword goes flying *backward* into a tree. I thought for sure that was it, but then the ogre *slips*--"

Missoni laughs at Peatwyn!

Missoni disbelievingly gasps, "It did not!"

Jisandra chuckles.

Peatwyn swears, "My hand to Koar, it did!"

Peatwyn laughingly continues, "The thing's club flew up in the air, came down on its own head, knocking it out cold! This poor fellow gets up, spots me watching and just kind of dusts his hands off, yells out - no joke - yells out, 'Just as I planned!' and strolls off without another word!"

Missoni shakes her head, totally at a loss.

Jisandra skeptically laughs, "Not a word? Did he even get his sword back?"

Peatwyn starts chortling.

Peatwyn amusedly says, "He tried, but it was well and truly stuck. I managed to free it, hopefully I'll run into him again sometime so I can get it back to him."

Jisandra shakes her head.

Cryheart chides, "You must be joking. There's no way..."

Peatwyn rebukes, "Would I lie to you?"

The corners of Peatwyn's sea green eyes wrinkle as he grins.

Guarrin stands up.

Cryheart raises an eyebrow.

Guarrin firmly says, "That is enough, for now. We are not here to re-live old battles, but to prepare for new ones."

Jisandra cocks her head.

Missoni tilts her head up.

Guarrin continues, "We are here because we are united in a common purpose, and because these fortifications offer us what we need - a place to rally, and a place to build upon the mission we all share."

Missoni gruffly asks, "And we do all share that mission, yes?"

Missoni looks pointedly at Sir Maldon.

Guarrin meets Lady Cinabar's gaze without malice, and inclines his head in agreement.

Missoni glances appraisingly at Guarrin.

Jisandra narrows her eyes.

Guarrin quietly says, "I know I have done little, yet, to earn your trust, but I hope for this to be a beginning. For us, and for protecting the Landing's freedom."

Jisandra stands up.

Jisandra rises, pacing the room for a moment as if restless.

Missoni gazes with interest at Jisandra.

Jisandra firmly says, "We shall see. For now, it appears we need your help, regardless.' She pauses, hesitating before admitting, 'I do not think anyone else here has helped to form a knightly order before."

Cryheart nods his agreement, frowning

Cryheart admits, "Before hearing about it from you, I was under the impression chivalry was what someone did if they spent too long in Icemule without a cloak."

Jisandra stares at Cryheart.

Missoni groans at Cryheart.

Guarrin grumbles to himself.

Cryheart winks.

Jisandra gazes heavenward.

Peatwyn interjects, "But Wanton and Brinn have a point. We are not alone in our purpose. Many people protect the Landing. We owe our lives to a lot of them. But that won't be enough for Baron Hochstib and his ilk."

Missoni nods firmly at Peatwyn.

Missoni affirms, "And that's why he's here." She gestures to Sir Maldon, her gaze not softening. "And not skewered. If we're to make Jantalar see us as a force to be reckoned with, he has the best chance of showing us how."

Guarrin calmly says, "Jantalar - Baron Hochstib - he looks down on people he deems to be common. He recognizes strength in nobility. And the virtues of following such a path are a source of great strength, when wielded by the right hands. Hands that are not corrupted."

Guarrin looks away for a moment, his features twisted into a bitter scowl before he composes himself.

Jisandra firmly says, "We need something to rally around. A banner. A symbol."

Cryheart raises an eyebrow.

Cryheart suggests, "... an oath?"

Missoni gazes with interest at Cryheart.

Peatwyn nods thoughtfully as the torchlight flickers. The group lapses into a thoughtful silence as the curtains slowly lower.

Jisandra cocks her head.

The curtain slowly closes.

The curtain slowly opens.

Glancing up on stage you see...

[Cholen's Temple, Stage]
The stage lighting -- created by evenly spaced oil lamps hung over the proscenium -- illuminates the wide-planked stage.  A new coat of polish is unable to hide the scuffs and marks left by decades of actors.  You also see the stage left entrance, the stage right entrance, the proscenium steps and the stage curtain.
Also here: Perigourd
Obvious exits: none

Perigourd stands before his polished mahogany desk, a missive held in his hand that he reads via torchlight. Military maps are strewn out before him, dotted with carved markers.

Perigourd glowers.

Perigourd grimly says, "So... Sir Maldon's sense of honor has been skewed. Corruption spreads quickly in the Landing, so I've heard."

Perigourd paces to a pedestal, hand resting lightly on a glowing shard that sits atop it.

Perigourd picks idly at a Mandis Crystal shard.

Perigourd growls, "Defiance will not bring you freedom. You shall only receive what the Mandis crystal shall bestow... ruination."

Perigourd drops his hand from the pedestal and steps back. The Mandis crystal pulses as all else goes dark, a beating heart stilled only as the 
curtain falls.

The curtain slowly closes.

The curtain slowly opens.

Glancing up on stage you see...

[Cholen's Temple, Stage]
The stage lighting -- created by evenly spaced oil lamps hung over the proscenium -- illuminates the wide-planked stage.  A new coat of polish is unable to hide the scuffs and marks left by decades of actors.  You also see the stage left entrance, the stage right entrance, the proscenium steps and the stage curtain.
Also here: Jisandra, Sir Guarrin, Sir Cryheart, Peatwyn, Lady Missoni
Obvious exits: none

Jisandra stands shoulder to shoulder with Lady Cinabar, Lord Brinn, Lord Welan, and Sir Maldon, all lit against an otherwise bare stage. The banner of a silver gryphon emblazoned on an ebony background, encircled with a ruby border, hangs overhead. Lady Wanton steps forward.

Jisandra clearly says, "In the years that followed, Baron Hochstib did not forget our defiance."

Missoni moves forward to stand alongside Lady Wanton.

Missoni raises her chin slightly in a show of defiance.

Missoni states, "He tried to grow his empire far beyond the borders of Jantalar. By threat, by trickery, and by blood."

Peatwyn steps up next to Lady Cinabar.

Peatwyn declares, "He wielded the Mandis crystals, gifts from Empress Myanal'lyanna herself, trying to suppress the magic that helped to protect the Landing from his invading forces. He tried to silence those who would resist."

Cryheart strides forward to stand beside Lord Welan.

Cryheart narrates, "He ordered the assassination of Baron Malwind of Vornavis, attempting to remove one of the last noble voices that stood against him."

Guarrin aligns himself with Lord Brinn.

Guarrin says, "He sought to occupy the Landing, and Icemule trace, trying to add them to his holdings. But he did not move unchecked."

Jisandra says, "At every turn, the citizens of the Landing stood in his way, and the Order of the Silver Gryphon opposed his every move. And from that, our oath, and our purpose, was born."

Missoni takes a deep breath.

Missoni recites:

    "To protect those who cannot protect themselves."

Peatwyn recites:

    "To aid those who are in need, if their cause is just."

Cryheart recites:

    "To serve with honor, by example and deed."

Guarrin bows his head, and the others follow suit. As the lights fade, only the banner of the Silver Gryphon remains illuminated, until finally the stage goes dark.

Missoni hangs her head.

Peatwyn hangs his head.

The curtain slowly closes.
