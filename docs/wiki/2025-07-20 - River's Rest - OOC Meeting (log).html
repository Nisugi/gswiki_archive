</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Greetings!  I'm GM Optheria, and I am your new Town Guru for River's Rest!  I'm a long-time GS player, and have been a fan of River's Rest since the early 2000's, with several RR citizens residing in my stable of characters.
</p>
<h2><span id="OPTHERIA.27S_LIST"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="OPTHERIA'S_LIST">OPTHERIA'S LIST</span></h2>
<p>Optheria says, "First... monthly citizen GALD sessions.... I'll be having monthly sessions, with a variety of weekday daytime, weekday evening, and weekend daytimes, rotating throughout.  I'll keep a spinner for three months, before I clean it."
</p><p>Optheria says, "Second, I've got one of my fellow GM's doing citizen WPS services, twice a year... I think one of those might be this month, actually... so, keep an eye out for those."
Optheria says, "For the Citizen GALD, you'll need to have 90+ days of citizenship.  For Citizen WPS, you'll need 180+ days."
</p><p>Optheria says, "I'm looking into getting a monthly Farmer's Market sort of thing going on, akin to Ta'Illistim's Wisteria Markets.  I don't have anything solid yet, but it's the first thing I'm going to be working on that is a new project for the town."
</p><p>Optheria says, "Continued updates and possible refreshes to the town shops will be on a rolling basis... most especially any stores that sell food, that aren't on the current food system (ala, food that can't go into baskets being updated to be able to be basket-ed)."
</p><p>Optheria says, "I *know* higher hunting is a thing everyone wants, and I do as well... it is definitely on my radar, but a very LARGE project, so I have no timeframe/timeline for that... but, it is on my radar, and something I'm excited to work on for all of us."
</p><p>Optheria says, "Another idea with some meat that I've received with the guruship was a plan for expanding our Voln Monastery here... it would be all roleplay expansion, but still... most things to explore and enjoy.  That is low on the list, compared to the Farmer's Market and hunting, but still there."
</p><p>Optheria says, "And finally, yet another idea, was an Aeian temple.  Again, mostly roleplay-centric, but something that may be useful."
</p><p>Optheria says, "Again, the monestary expansion and Aeian temple are low on my list, with the Farmer's Market and hunting ground being pretty high.  Just listing off my ideas and such."
</p><p>Optheria says, "And, of course, no timeline/timeframe for any of this.  I'm going to try to be as open as possible with you all."
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="QUESTIONS">QUESTIONS</span></h2>
<p><b>First question:</b><br/>
"First of all, welcome again Optheria. I think you have mostly covered off all my questions, especially with regards to hunting ground, but since I am here. Any storyline RP planned for the future?"<br/>
Optheria says, "I don't have anything specific for storyline RP currently, but I am ALWAYS open to suggestions."<br/>
Optheria says, "Will probably have a storyline for any sort of hunting grounds being opened, in the future."
</p><p><b>Second question:</b><br/>
"Seeing as only dev GM's can make hunting grounds and they are busy on their own plans for forever which one are you suggesting we kidnap?"<br/>
Optheria says, "I have my ideas on that... which I can't share at this time, unfortunately."
</p><p><b>Third Question:</b><br/>
"In regards to storyline ideas, or even ideas for hunting zones, what would be the best way to get those over to you for consideration?"<br/>
Optheria says, "My email is open, GS4-Optheria (at) play.net.  Please put in the subject -River's Rest-, so I know how to sort it."<br/>
Optheria says, "And that goes for anyone with ideas for the town."<br/>
Optheria says, "I can't promise I will DO any of the ideas, but I definitely welcome the input."
</p><p><b>Fourth Question:</b><br/>
"As for hunting, I think the area under the town before the blue barrier is not in The Citadel." "Is there any plans to address that point, like making it part of the Sea Caves or a relevant zone?" "Yes, the River Tunnels shouldn't have a LOCATION of the Citadel."<br/>
Optheria says, "Okay, that's precisely the information I was going for.  I'll look into it and see what I can find, and if it can, or should be, fixed."
</p><p><b>Fifth Question:</b><br/>
"Can the various single room herbs be looked at for a possible expansion? I can't remember specifics as I leveled out a month or so back, but there was a few herbs that only appeared in one single room for bounties in the Citadel area."<br/>
Optheria says, "I can investigate this as well.. I agree that it can be a pain when there is only one room in a whole area that has things for foraging for bounties."<br/>
Optheria says, "I can't promise anything, of course, but I'll put it on my list for investigation."
</p><p><b>Sixth Question:</b><br/>
Speaking squeakily to Optheria, Ntinly asks, "Wha kin I pay yas ta has ma title changed from Picklsmaster ta Picklemistress?"<br/>
Speaking to Ntinly, Optheria exclaims, "No pay needed, I actually want to see if we can get that title able to be master or mistress!"<br/>
Optheria exclaims, "We already have premium titles that look at that specific part of a character to see which title to give, so it shouldn't be too annoying to get.  I can't promise it, of course, but definitely will look into it!"<br/>
(left the name because well, we all know who is the Picklemaster)
</p><p><b>Seventh Question:</b><br/>
"On the subject of bounties, is it possible as a stop gap, to have capped, or near-capped, bandits from the adventurer's guild?  I haven't tried recently but last time I did I wasn't allowed to get any kind of bounty."<br/>
Optheria says, "So, the adventurer's guild first checks to see if you can learn from anything in the realm....  no matter what type of bounty it's going to give after that check.  It's how the guild was built.  The only work-around, to get near-cap/cap bandits is to wear a Confluence soulstone... and then, you'd remove any Confluence bounties you get, to get to the bandits."
</p><p><b>Eighth Question:</b><br/>
"Still thin we need true capped huntin round here.... bandit an pirates neva did me wrong."<br/>
Optheria says, "I hope to work on hunting grounds for higher levels in the future... going to start with levels just over what the Citadel has, and work my way up from there.  No timeline/timeframe, but it is definitely high on my list of things I want to do."
</p><p><b>Ninth Question:</b><br/>
"So because I hate hoarding crystal amulets, any chance in the future residents could get some kind of magical trinket that would let them just pass through the log?"<br/>
Optheria says, "Yup, driftwood is a thing... I don't remember if it's RR-&gt;Landing or Landing-&gt;RR though.."<br/>
Driftwood amulets work like Crystal amulets for the boot but can only be purchased by Citizens in RR. Cheaper too 
</p><p><b>Tenth Question:</b><br/>
"We used to have duffel bags.  Xayle didn't like that and altered things as duffle bags, but left the ones in the shop alone.  More recently, those and gaffs and other things have all become illegal.  Any plans for mixing things up as far as shops and item nouns?"<br/>
Optheria says, "Indeed... if I do refreshes of shops, I'm going to try and make things more Rest-y unique."
(will have advanced notice of any shop refreshing, as well.)
</p><p><b>Eleventh Question:</b><br/>
"Are there (premium) houses here?"<br/>
Optheria says, "Yup, we've got three different premium home neighborhoods... two in-town, and one to the south of town."<br/>
Optheria says, "A good map of those neighborhoods here:  <a class="external free" href="/wiki/images_SLASH_gswiki_SLASH_2_SLASH_24_SLASH_Homes4.gif.html" rel="nofollow">https://gswiki.play.net/images/gswiki/2/24/Homes4.gif</a>   .."<br/>
"If they fill up, do we email you about more spaces?"<br/>
Optheria says, "Yup, or ask on the River's Rest forum, or on the Premium forum on the Discord server."
