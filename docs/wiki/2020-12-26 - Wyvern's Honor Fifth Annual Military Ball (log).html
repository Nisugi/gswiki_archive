<pre style="margin-right: 20%; margin-left: 2em; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 7px 10px; background: #f3f3f9; border: line; text-align: left; font-size:95%; font-family: Consolas, DejaVu sans mono, Courier New, monospace; color: black; white-space: pre-wrap; white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; white-space: -pre-wrap; white-space: -o-pre-wrap;">A young elven page wearing a slightly oversized crimson samite tabard bearing a wyvern in gold threading enters the area with a scroll in hand.  He clears his throat as he unfurls the parchment and announces, "Hear ye, hear ye!  For those attending the Annual Military Ball, hosted by the Wyvern's Honor, please proceed to the tent in Amaranth Court.  The festivities are about to begin."  He rerolls the parchment and wanders to the next area.

[Midnight Blue Tent]
The deep blue silk overhead has been painted to resemble the night sky, complete with moons.  Bronze lanterns dangle from the tent posts, creating pools of soft, flickering light.  Gold and blue velvet cushions heaped in the corners provide quiet places to rest.  You also see a bright copper cart with some stuff on it.
Also here: Squire Legionnaire Raxl
Obvious exits: out

You smile at Raxl.

Raxl nods in greeting.

You say, "Good eve."

Raxl says, "Good evening."

Gentle melodies flow forth from the musicians' instruments.

You say, "I hope there's a good turn out tonight."

Raxl says, "Same."

Raxl says, "It's a bit early, but should be at least a few coming this evening."

You nod.

The music seems to wind on forever, bringing old memories and thoughts long forgotten to the surface of your mind.

You say, "The calendar says 9:00.  Folks should show about then."

Raxl chuckles.

Raxl says, "I know."

Raxl says, "I organized it this year."

You say, "True, you did."

You laugh softly, trying to hide your amusement.

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

You say, "The little herald ran through King's Court earlier and said it was about to begin."

Raxl says, "I know."

Raxl says, "I sent a thought out that he was reprimanded for going out early."

Raxl says, "But that the ball would be held at the top of the hour."

You say, "Got some worried that they were running late."

The musicians end on a soft and gentle note.

Raxl says, "Yeah, it's why I clarified it with my thought."

Raxl says, "Or apparently I thought I had, but some may not have heard."

Raxl shrugs.

Raxl struts out of the area with a flourish.

The musicians strike up an old romantic ballad.

You grin.

Squire Legionnaire Raxl just arrived.

Rmalie just arrived.

Rmalie smiles at you.

She has old battle scars on her left leg.

Rmalie softly says, "Oh."

Rmalie beams happily at you!

Rmalie gives you a friendly hug, and you detect the faint scent of absinthe, night-blooming jasmine, and well-seasoned oak around her.

Speaking to Rmalie, you say, "You look lovely."

You hug Rmalie.

Rmalie softly says, "Is all I could do."

Rmalie chuckles.

Rmalie softly says, "I am grateful that I have the gown now."

Speaking to Rmalie, you ask, "Have you met Squire Raxl?"

Rmalie chuckles.

Rmalie looks over at you and shakes her head.

Rmalie turns to face Raxl.

Rmalie curtsies to Raxl.

You say, "Rmalie, this is Squire Legionnaire Raxl."

A strolling band of musicians begins a sprightly dance tune.

You feel at full magical power again.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "Most folks call me the Rascal of Ta'Vaalor.  I'm sure I don't know why."

Raxl winks at Rmalie.

Speaking to Raxl, you say, "This is Rmalie.  She's a young cleric."

Raxl bows to Rmalie.

Speaking softly to Raxl, Rmalie says, "Hello, sir."

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "The pleasure is mine."

Rmalie smiles at Raxl.

Rmalie softly says, "I happen to be fond of rascals."

Rmalie grins.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "That may be a first for this town."

Raxl chuckles.

Rmalie chuckles.

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

Rmalie softly says, "Makes life interesting."

Rmalie nods.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "The ball officially starts at the top of the hour, but feel free to help yourself to some refreshments if you like."

Raxl glances at a bright copper cart.

A strolling band of musicians begins a sprightly dance tune.

Raxl says, "I demanded the cookies, the rest the staff threw together."

Raxl helps himself to a berry-filled lemon finger cookie.

Raxl takes a bite of his lemon finger cookie.

Raxl takes a bite of his lemon finger cookie.

Speaking softly to Raxl, Rmalie asks, "Thank you.  Tell me, did you start as a legionnaire at a young age?"

Raxl takes a bite of his lemon finger cookie.

Rmalie softly says, "They look delicious."

Rmalie smiles.

As the tune finishes, the gathered listeners applaud gently.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "I served my 100 as soon as I could and then got out.  Seems orders and structure didn't mix well with my rascally nature."

Rmalie softly says, "I see."

Rmalie nods at Raxl.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "Then a couple of years ago, I met the High Priestess and she inspired me to join the reserves and so, here I am."

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Raxl ponders.

Speaking softly to Raxl, Rmalie says, "Ah a reservist. That is a noble thing.  At the ready if needed."

Raxl says, "I guess it's been more than a couple of years... time sure does fly."

Rmalie nods at Raxl.

Rmalie smiles at Raxl.

Raxl nods at Rmalie.

The music seems to wind on forever, bringing old memories and thoughts long forgotten to the surface of your mind.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "I've never shirked my duty as a citizen to defend the fortress, just not so good at marching and staying in line sometimes."

Raxl winks.

Speaking softly to Raxl, Rmalie says, "I can understand that.  I am often  causing  things to go awry without meaning to."

A strolling band of musicians begins a sprightly dance tune.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "I feel your pain, most of my troubles stem from Somersby and his pub crawls."

Rmalie softly says, "So I will offer my services restoring life here in the fortress as long as I can."

Raxl says, "I'm compteley innocent in the matters."

Raxl snickers.

Rmalie begins chuckling at Raxl!

You laugh out loud!

Rmalie clasps her hand over her mouth.

You cough.

You set about preparing yourself to be as presentable as possible.

Rmalie appears to be struggling to keep a straight face as she glances at you.

The musicians end on a soft and gentle note.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "A noble profession and one that everyone needs sooner or later."

Speaking softly to Raxl, Rmalie says, "I hope to be as good as those that practice well now, such as  Lady Ammethyst and Lady Esana."

The soft melodies of a silver-stringed harp and an alto recorder fill the evening air as the musicians begin a song echoing the soft breezes of spring.

The group finishes the music and pauses to let the listeners chat a bit.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "I don't know if I've met Lady ammethyst but I do know the High Priestess well.  I'm sure she'd be willing to give you any help along the way, should you need it."

You notice Ithilwyn moving stealthily into the room.

Ithilwyn curtsies.

Ithilwyn softly says, "Good evening."

Ithilwyn smiles.

Raxl nods to Ithilwyn in greeting.

Twisting vines writhe around Ithilwyn, obscuring her in an ever-shifting barrier of thorns.

Speaking softly to Raxl, Rmalie says, "I am sure she will.  Lady Ammethyst has taught me so much already."

Rmalie smiles at Raxl.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "By the way, your gown is lovely."

Rmalie curtsies to Ithilwyn.

Ithilwyn curtsies to Rmalie.

Ithilwyn grins.

Speaking softly to Raxl, Rmalie says, "Thank you."

The musicians strike up an old romantic ballad.

Speaking to Ithilwyn, you say, "You look lovely."

Speaking softly to you, Ithilwyn exclaims, "Thank you!"

Rmalie softly says, "It was a mad dash and a throwing on of the garments."

Rmalie chuckles.

Rmalie turns to face Ithilwyn.

Rmalie softly says, "Yes, you are breathtaking."

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "I took the safe route and came in uniform."

Rmalie smiles at Ithilwyn.

Raxl chuckles.

Rmalie grins at Raxl.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "Less stress and anxiety."

Speaking softly to Raxl, Rmalie says, "I envy that."

Rmalie grins.

Speaking softly to Raxl, Ithilwyn says, "I'm sure you would look handsome in anything."

Ithilwyn grins.

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

Speaking to Ithilwyn, Raxl says, "Why thank you for the compliment.  I believe that made my evening."

Rmalie smiles.

Ithilwyn grins.

A strolling band of musicians begins a sprightly dance tune.

Raxl whispers something to Rmalie.

Raxl appears to be trying hard not to grin.

Rmalie grins at Raxl.

As the tune finishes, the gathered listeners applaud gently.

The air about Ithilwyn stops shimmering.

Ithilwyn seems to lose some internal strength.

Raxl says, "If nobody else shows tonight, I believe my dance card will be full."

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Rmalie chuckles.

Ithilwyn grins.

Raxl says, "Not that I'd mind, of course."

Ithilwyn softly says, "I'm sure people will arrive soon."

Raxl nods.

Rmalie agrees with Ithilwyn.

Raxl says, "It is early still."

You say, "I was just thinking about the year our Sovereign and Heartfire did a stomp dance together."

As the tune finishes, the gathered listeners applaud gently.

Rmalie softly says, "Yes, I am only early because I panicked when Krystalena told me of the ball."

Rmalie chuckles.

Rmalie turns to face you.

Ithilwyn grins at Rmalie.

Rmalie softly asks, "A stomp dance?"

Rmalie peers quizzically at you.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "Well, I for one am pleased you panicked."

Raxl smiles.

Rmalie smiles at Raxl.

Rmalie inclines her head.

Speaking softly to Raxl, Rmalie says, "You are very kind."

Speaking to you, Raxl says, "I'm not certain I was present for that one."

Gentle melodies flow forth from the musicians' instruments.

Ithilwyn seems to lose some dexterity.

Speaking to Rmalie, you say, "Heartfire is a giantkin who wears elf ears.  He's gone right up to our Sovereign and asked him for a dance."

Rmalie chuckles.

Rmalie laughs!

Rmalie clasps her hand over her mouth.

The music seems to wind on forever, bringing old memories and thoughts long forgotten to the surface of your mind.

Rmalie softly says, "I am sure that was a sight to behold."

Ithilwyn giggles.

Rmalie chuckles.

Ithilwyn softly says, "Our King is a delight."

Speaking to you, Raxl says, "I am so sorry I missed that."

You say, "I've never seen him do it since, but that was one I'll never forget."

Rmalie smiles.

Gentle melodies flow forth from the musicians' instruments.

You say, "Please excuse me.  I need to fetch my husband."

Speaking softly to Ithilwyn, Rmalie says, "Congratulations to you and your husband.  He is very kind."

Raxl nods to Orssus in greeting.

Rulli gets a distant look in his eyes.

Rulli nods in greeting at Raxl.

Raxl waves to Rulli.

Orssus nods in greeting at Raxl.

Speaking softly to Rmalie, Ithilwyn says, "Thank you!  I do adore him so."

Ithilwyn smiles.

He has a stylized Crimson Legion tattoo on his wrist.

Rmalie smiles at Ithilwyn.

Speaking to Raxl, Rulli says, "Good to see you this evening, Lord Rascal."

Rulli smirks.

Rmalie nods to Orssus in greeting.

Ithilwyn softly says, "I should go see where he is."

Rmalie nods to Rulli in greeting.

Ithilwyn curtsies.

Great Lady Ithilwyn just went out.

Orssus nods to Rmalie in greeting.

Rulli bows to Rmalie.

Rmalie curtsies to Rulli.

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

Speaking to Rulli, Raxl says, "And you as well fine sir.  It's not a pub crawl, but there is champagne and ale."

Raxl appears to be trying hard not to grin.

Rulli chuckles.

Orssus relaxes and no longer maintains the Executioner's Stance.

Speaking to Raxl, Rulli says, "Seems I'll be sticking to some tea. Don't want to get in trouble drinking in uniform."

Faint golden lines trace across Rulli's skin as he appears to focus...

Rulli gestures.

Speaking to Rulli, Raxl says, "I've been nervous about this all day."

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Rulli gives a sidelong glance at Raxl.

Speaking to Raxl, Rulli says, "You, nervous? I can hardly believe it."

Speaking softly to Raxl, Rmalie says, "Don't be nervous.  I will protect you."

Speaking to Rulli, Raxl says, "Fancy fuctions and myself sometimes don't go well together."

Rmalie appears to be struggling to keep a straight face as she glances at Raxl.

Raxl shuffles his feet.

Rulli chuckles.

Speaking to Raxl, Rulli asks, "Where's your better half?"

Orssus steals a kiss as he sways with you across the dance floor.

Orssus chuckles.

You smile at Orssus.

Speaking to Rulli, Raxl says, "I'm not sure if she's going to be able to make it tonight.  I hope but haven't heard."

The musicians end on a soft and gentle note.

Rulli nods.

Speaking to Laehna, you say, "Welcome, you look lovely this evening."

You smile at Laehna.

Speaking to Raxl, Rulli says, "She's a nice lady, a good one."

Rmalie turns to face Laehna.

Laehna smiles at you.

Rmalie curtsies to Laehna.

Speaking to Rulli, Raxl says, "What about you, any ladies in your future."

Speaking softly to you, Laehna says, "Why thank you so much, you look lovely as well."

Rulli shakes his head.

Laehna curtsies.

Gentle melodies flow forth from the musicians' instruments.

Speaking to Raxl, Rulli says, "It almost happened, but it didn't. For the best."

Raxl nods slowly.

Orssus rubs his suede gauntlets.

Speaking politely to Raxl, Laehna asks, "I'm doing quite well, thank you. And yourself?"

Speaking to Rulli, Raxl says, "I'll find you someone nice."

Rulli chuckles.

Laehna smiles at Raxl.

Rulli looks over at Raxl and shakes his head.

Speaking to Laehna, Raxl says, "Well, I'm sober so that must mean I'm good."

Rmalie pours herself a cup of smoky tea.

Raxl appears to be trying hard not to grin.

Laehna laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.

Rmalie takes a drink from her smoky tea.

The musicians end on a soft and gentle note.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "The ale is fantastic."

Raxl glances at a frosted glass of honey ale on a bright copper cart.

Speaking to Rmalie, Rulli says, "You make that look delicious. So much so you've tempted me into a cup."

Rmalie smiles at Raxl.

Rulli pours himself a cup of smoky tea.

Laehna pours herself a flute of rose-infused champagne.

Raxl starts chortling.

Rmalie inclines her head.

Rulli takes a drink from his smoky tea.

Rmalie smiles at Rulli.

Rulli ponders.

Speaking to Rmalie, Rulli says, "Not bad at all."

The dim aura fades from around Orssus.

Speaking softly to Rulli, Rmalie says, "I am Rmalie.  The tea is indeed lovely."

As the troubadours begin another set, several couples nearby begin a lively ring dance.

Rulli blushes a florid shade of crimson.

Speaking to Laehna, Raxl says, "I absolutely love the teardrop ruby in your hair.  Such a simple, yet elegant touch."

Laehna blushes a soft apricot shade at Raxl.

Speaking embarrassedly to Rmalie, Rulli says, "Forgive me for just speaking without an introduction."

Speaking to Rmalie, Rulli says, "Rulli, at your service."

Laehna softly exclaims, "Thank you, I'd almost completely forgotten about it!"

Laehna reaches out and touches her vaalin geldaralad.

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "Careful.  You're making that gown look good as well and he may try one of those next."

Raxl just nudged Rulli.

Speaking softly to Rulli, Rmalie says, "No forgiveness needed, I forget to introduce myself properly."

Laehna laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.

Rulli gives Raxl a little prod between the shoulder blades.

Rmalie begins chuckling at Raxl!

You find yourself humming along to the music and catch yourself just as it ends.

You smile at Laehna.

Laehna sinks down in a deep curtsy before you, her lashes lowered.

Speaking softly to Raxl, Rmalie says, "That is a rascally thing to say."

Rmalie grins.

Speaking to Rmalie, Rulli says, "Definitely a troublemaker that one."

Speaking to Rmalie, Raxl says, "I'd hate to disappoint."

Rulli gives a sidelong glance at Raxl.

Raxl laughs!

Speaking softly to Rulli, Rmalie says, "We seem to have that in common."

Rmalie grins.

Rulli chuckles.

The soft melodies of a silver-stringed harp and an alto recorder fill the evening air as the musicians begin a song echoing the soft breezes of spring.

Speaking to Orssus, Raxl asks, "How have you been?"

Squire Legionnaire Taulramil's group just arrived.

Laehna takes a drink from her rose-infused champagne.

Taulramil snaps to attention and crisply strikes his chest with a closed fist.

Laehna smiles at Taulramil.

Rmalie curtsies to Taulramil.

Orssus says, "Been well, spending a lot of spare time in the forge these days."

He has a trio of laje rings dangling a black diamond half-moon in the upper ridge of his left ear, a rune tattoo on his arm, a deep black deathstone spike in his right eyebrow, a golden tribal wyvern tattoo on his neck, and a rune tattoo on his arm.

Taulramil says, "Good evening."

Rmalie smiles at Taulramil.

Taulramil bows.

Ithilwyn grins.

Rmalie softly says, "Good Evening."

Speaking to Orssus, Raxl asks, "Learning anything, or just making stock?"

Rmalie smiles at Ithilwyn.

Orssus says, "I've just about mastered two-handed weapon forging."

Speaking to Raxl, Rulli says, "I heard a story about you and Somersby. You two and maybe another went on quite the weekend bender.  Didn't make it home for four days."

Raxl cringes.

The music seems to wind on forever, bringing old memories and thoughts long forgotten to the surface of your mind.

Rmalie raises an eyebrow in Rulli's direction.

Speaking to Rulli, Raxl asks, "Who talked!?"

Laehna softly mouths, "Four days?"

Rulli chuckles.

Orssus and Taulramil bash their forearms in greeting.

Rmalie nods at Laehna.

Laehna surreptitiously glances at Raxl.

Taulramil says, "That must have been some event, four day recovery."

Orssus waves to Ithilwyn.

Taulramil chuckles.

Rmalie fidgets.

Ithilwyn waves to Orssus.

Ithilwyn grins.

Laehna takes a drink from her rose-infused champagne.

Rmalie softly says, "What a long time."

Ithilwyn pours herself a flute of rose-infused champagne.

Rmalie glances around the room.

Ithilwyn takes a drink from her rose-infused champagne.

Rmalie appears to be struggling to keep a straight face as she glances at Raxl.

Speaking to Taulramil, Rulli says, "From what I undertstood, they couldn't find their way home for those four days."

Laehna laughs softly, trying to hide her amusement.

Rulli glances at Raxl.

Rulli chuckles.

Rmalie chuckles.

Taulramil chuckles.

A strolling band of musicians begins a sprightly dance tune.

Raxl regretfully says, "It was a good time, but yes directions were quite the challenge."

Rulli takes a drink from his smoky tea.

Taulramil pours himself a frosted glass of honey ale.

Taulramil takes a drink from his honey ale.

Rmalie takes a drink from her smoky tea.

Raxl says, "For some reason directions to the next pub were always quite clear, but finidng our way home was difficult."
