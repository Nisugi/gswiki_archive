The deep blue silk overhead has been painted to resemble the night sky, complete with moons.  Bronze lanterns dangle from the tent posts, creating pools of soft, flickering light.  Gold and blue velvet cushions heaped in the corners provide quiet places to rest.  You also see a bright copper cart with some stuff on it.
Also here: Squire Legionnaire Ziria, High Legionnaire Kakoon, Lady Qiana, Lord Legionnaire Commander Jaranzair, First Legionnaire Esana

    "The Wyvern's Honor would like to welcome everyone this evening for the third annual military ball.  It is wonderful to have you all, please feel free to enjoy the foods from the cart and the dance floor of course.
