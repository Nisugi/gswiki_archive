<p>You analyze your rune-etched platemail and sense that the creator has provided the following information:
The description of the rune-etched platemail may be freely altered.
</p><p>The rune-etched platemail is Valence Armor, which temporarily allows its bearer to tap into the energy of various other valences and channel that power in offensive and defensive ways.
</p><p>The platemail is tier 4 of 4.  This means that it has access to the following verbs: REMOVE, WEAR, Reactive Flares (Lash of Lorae'tyr), POKE, TOUCH, PUSH (Surge of the Rift), PROD, RUB, PULL (Shroud of Shien'tyr), CLENCH, TAP, BESEECH (Light of Kol Tar'sken).  Bearing both a Valence Armor and a Valence Weapon unlocks a special ability (Volley of the Verlok), which is activated via KNOCK to release a number of attacks toward a target based on the average tier of the armor and weapon.  When successful, this ability also inflicts Blindness on the target.
</p><p>You might be able to have a talented merchant lighten the rune-etched platemail for you.
</p><p>The platemail is restricted to this account.
