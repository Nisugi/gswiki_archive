The deep blue silk overhead has been painted to resemble the night sky, complete with moons.  Bronze lanterns dangle from the tent posts, creating pools of soft, flickering light.

Agathilea nods politely at Astari.

Celaena raises an eyebrow.

Nekales quietly says, "Keilee has no intention of using her bow in here, It's simply one loaned to her by a friend and i don't think it's ever been out of her sight since he did."
